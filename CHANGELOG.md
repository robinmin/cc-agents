# CHANGELOG

## [1.5.2] - 2026-01-15

### Summary

**Plugin Hooks Bug Fix**

Fixed JSON validation error in Stop hook by correcting the prompt-based hook output format to match Claude Code specification.

### Fixed

- **Stop Hook JSON Validation Error** (`plugins/rd/hooks/hooks.json`):
  - Root cause: Prompt was requesting incorrect JSON output format (`{"ok": true}` instead of `{"decision": "approve"}`)
  - Updated Stop hook prompt to use correct decision format:
    - `{"decision": "approve", "reason": "..."}` to allow stopping
    - `{"decision": "block", "reason": "...", "systemMessage": "..."}` to continue working
  - Changed field names: `ok` → `decision`, boolean `true/false` → string `"approve"/"block"`
  - Added `systemMessage` field for block case (optional but recommended)

### References

- [Claude Code Hooks Documentation - Stop Event](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/plugins/plugin-dev/skills/hook-development/SKILL.md#stop)
- Stop hook output specification: `{"decision": "approve|block", "reason": "...", "systemMessage": "..."}`

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-13

### Summary

**Task Orchestration Architecture Overhaul**

Major release introducing a complete task orchestration system with two specialized subagents working in tandem: `task-decomposition-expert` for planning and `task-runner` for execution. This release establishes checkpoint discipline, TodoWrite synchronization, and expert delegation patterns.

### Added

- **New Subagent: `task-runner` (`plugins/rd/agents/task-runner.md`)**:
  - Senior Task Execution Specialist with checkpoint discipline
  - Sequential phase execution with atomic checkpoint writes
  - Status state machine: `pending` → `in_progress` → `completed` | `blocked`
  - Expert Agent Delegation Protocol (Section 5.5) — signals delegation needs to parent context
  - Resume capability via `--resume` flag for interrupted work
  - TodoWrite synchronization after every status change

- **Expert Agent Delegation Protocol**:
  - Clear separation: subagents signal needs, parent context (Claude Code) invokes experts
  - Decision tree for delegation routing (Python → python-expert, TypeScript → typescript-expert, etc.)
  - Structured delegation signal format with recommended expert and prompt

- **Batch Execution Pattern**:
  - 3-7 implementation phases for task-runner consumption
  - Phase independence with verifiable deliverables
  - Checkpoint discipline: write to disk after each phase

### Changed

- **Renamed Command: `/rd:task-run` → `/rd:task-runner`**:
  - Aligns with subagent naming convention
  - Updated all references in `task-fixall.md`, `tasks.md`, `agent-meta.md`

- **Refactored `/rd:task-runner` Command (`plugins/rd/commands/task-runner.md`)**:
  - Lean orchestration format delegating to specialized subagents
  - 66% reduction: 534 → 180 lines
  - Two-phase workflow: Planning (task-decomposition-expert) → Execution (task-runner)
  - Expert Delegation table for action pattern routing

- **Enhanced `task-decomposition-expert` (`plugins/rd/agents/task-decomposition-expert.md`)**:
  - 37% reduction: 592 → 370 lines (removed redundancy while preserving key content)
  - Added TodoWrite Synchronization Protocol to Section 4
  - Added Batch Execution Pattern to Section 5.1
  - Added Agent Invocation Format with Task tool examples
  - Updated Expert Agent Capabilities table (8 agents)
  - Consolidated decomposition patterns from 16 to 7 key patterns

- **Optimized `task-runner` Subagent (`plugins/rd/agents/task-runner.md`)**:
  - 54% reduction from initial draft: 789 → 366 lines
  - Merged redundant sections (5.3+5.6 → 5.3, 5.2+5.5 → 5.2)
  - Reduced output templates from 7 to 4
  - Preserved all critical protocols and verification steps

### Technical Details

**Task Tool Invocation Format:**
```python
Task(
  subagent_type="rd:task-decomposition-expert",
  prompt="Analyze and decompose task file: {task_file}",
  description="Decompose task into phases"
)
```

**TodoWrite Synchronization:**
- Task file `impl_progress` is source of truth
- TodoWrite mirrors for user visibility
- Sync immediately after every checkpoint

**Optimization Summary:**
| File | Before | After | Reduction |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| `task-runner.md` (agent) | 789 | 366 | 54% |
| `task-decomposition-expert.md` | 592 | 370 | 37% |
| `task-runner.md` (command) | 534 | 180 | 66% |
| **Total** | 1,915 | 916 | **52%** |

## [1.4.1] - 2026-01-12

### Summary

**Plugin Hooks Architecture & Browser Automation Agent**

This release introduces proper plugin-scoped hooks configuration, browser automation capabilities, and the `/tasks` slash command for task management from Claude's input field.

### Added

- **Browser Automation Agent (`plugins/rd/agnts/agent-browser.md`)**:
  - Ref-based browser automation expert using snapshot-first workflow
  - 66 competency items across 12 categories (navigation, snapshots, clicks, text input, screenshots, waits, semantic locators, sessions, debugging, workflows, pitfalls)
  - Core workflow: `open` → `snapshot -i` → interact with `@refs` → re-snapshot
  - 12 DO rules and 12 DON'T rules for reliable automation
  - Scored 92/100 on quality validation

- **Plugin Hooks Configuration (`plugins/rd/hooks/hooks.json`)**:
  - Moved plugin-specific hooks from global `~/.claude/settings.json` to plugin context
  - Proper wrapper format with `description` and `hooks` fields
  - Hook events: `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `Stop`, `SessionEnd`, `Notification`
  - Uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` which is only available in plugin context

- **New Scripts (`plugins/rd/scripts/`)**:
  - **`session-end.sh`**: SessionEnd cleanup with session logging, duration calculation, temp file cleanup, and state preservation to `.claude/last-session.json`
  - **`notification.sh`**: Notification handler with logging to `.claude/logs/notifications.log`, optional macOS notifications, and optional webhook integration

- **New Slash Command (`plugins/rd/commands/tasks.md`)**:
  - `/rd:tasks` command for task management from Claude input field
  - Wraps `tasks.sh` with all subcommands: `init`, `create`, `list`, `update`, `open`, `refresh`, `help`
  - Added `allowed-tools: Bash` for proper tool permissions

### Changed

- **Global Settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)**:
  - Removed plugin-specific hooks (SessionStart, PreToolUse, Stop) that incorrectly used `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
  - Retained PostToolUse formatters (biome, ruff, rustfmt, etc.) which use `$CLAUDE_FILE_PATH` and work in global context

### Fixed

- **PreToolUse:Bash hook error**: Fixed by moving hooks from global settings to plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` where `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is properly set by Claude Code
