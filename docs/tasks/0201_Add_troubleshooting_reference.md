## 0201. Add troubleshooting reference

### Background

The official Claude Skills Guide has a comprehensive troubleshooting section that is not present in cc-skills. Skill creators need systematic guidance for diagnosing and fixing common issues.

**Gap identified:** cc-skills has "Common Mistakes" section but no systematic "symptom → diagnosis → solution" troubleshooting guide.

### Requirements

- [ ] Create `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills/references/troubleshooting.md`
- [ ] Cover all major issue categories from official guide
- [ ] Include diagnostic commands/queries
- [ ] Add troubleshooting workflow section to SKILL.md

### Q&A

Q: Should troubleshooting be in SKILL.md or references/?
A: Brief workflow in SKILL.md, detailed guide in references/troubleshooting.md

### Design

**Issue Categories to Cover:**

1. **Skill Won't Upload**
   - Symptoms: "Could not find SKILL.md", "Invalid frontmatter", "Invalid skill name"
   - Causes: File naming, YAML formatting, name validation
   - Solutions: Rename to SKILL.md, fix YAML delimiters, use hyphen-case

2. **Skill Doesn't Trigger**
   - Symptoms: Skill never loads automatically, users manually enable
   - Causes: Generic description, missing trigger phrases, vague language
   - Solutions: Add specific phrases, include error messages as triggers
   - Debug: Ask Claude "When would you use the [skill] skill?"

3. **Skill Triggers Too Often**
   - Symptoms: Loads for unrelated queries, users disable it
   - Causes: Too broad description, missing scope
   - Solutions: Add negative triggers, be more specific, clarify scope

4. **Instructions Not Followed**
   - Symptoms: Claude ignores guidance, skips steps
   - Causes: Verbose instructions, buried content, ambiguous language, model "laziness"
   - Solutions: Keep concise, use ## Important headers, add explicit encouragement

5. **MCP Connection Issues**
   - Symptoms: Skill loads but MCP calls fail
   - Checklist: Server running, API keys valid, tool names correct

6. **Large Context Issues**
   - Symptoms: Skill slow, responses degraded
   - Solutions: Optimize SKILL.md size, move details to references/, reduce enabled skills

### Solution

Create structured troubleshooting guide with:
- Symptom → Diagnosis → Solution format
- Diagnostic commands/queries
- Checklist for each issue type

### Plan

1. Create `references/troubleshooting.md` with all 6 categories
2. Add "Troubleshooting" workflow section to SKILL.md
3. Cross-reference from Validation Checklist
4. Add to skill-creator integration (future)
