## 0200. Add skill patterns reference

### Background

The official Claude Skills Guide documents 5 proven skill patterns that are not currently covered in cc-skills. These patterns represent best practices for different skill use cases and should be documented to help skill creators choose the right approach.

**Gap identified:** cc-skills covers Technique/Pattern/Reference types but not the official 5 patterns (Sequential, Multi-MCP, Iterative, Context-aware, Domain-specific).

### Requirements

- [x] Create `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills/references/skill-patterns.md` documenting 5 official patterns
- [ ] Add pattern selection guidance to Step 2 (Plan Reusable Contents) in SKILL.md
- [x] Include examples for each pattern
- [x] Document when to use each pattern vs when NOT to use

### Q&A

Q: Should we add pattern-specific evaluation criteria?
A: Not in this task. Consider for future enhancement if patterns prove useful.

### Design

**5 Official Patterns to Document:**

1. **Sequential Workflow Orchestration** - Multi-step processes in specific order
   - Example: Customer onboarding (Create Account → Setup Payment → Create Subscription → Send Email)
   - Key techniques: Explicit ordering, dependencies, validation at each stage, rollback instructions

2. **Multi-MCP Coordination** - Workflows spanning multiple services
   - Example: Design-to-development handoff (Figma → Drive → Linear → Slack)
   - Key techniques: Clear phase separation, data passing, centralized error handling

3. **Iterative Refinement** - Quality loops with validation scripts
   - Example: Report generation with quality checks
   - Key techniques: Explicit quality criteria, validation scripts, know when to stop

4. **Context-Aware Tool Selection** - Decision trees for tool choice
   - Example: Smart file storage based on file type/size
   - Key techniques: Clear decision criteria, fallback options, transparency

5. **Domain-Specific Intelligence** - Embedded compliance, audit trails
   - Example: Payment processing with compliance checks
   - Key techniques: Domain expertise in logic, compliance before action, comprehensive documentation

### Solution

Created comprehensive reference file with:
- Pattern description and use cases
- Example structure (pseudocode)
- Key techniques checklist
- When to use / when NOT to use
- Quick decision guide

### Plan

1. [x] Create `references/skill-patterns.md` with all 5 patterns
2. [ ] Add pattern selection guidance to SKILL.md Step 2
3. [ ] Add link from SKILL.md Quick Reference to patterns
4. [ ] Test with skill creators for clarity
