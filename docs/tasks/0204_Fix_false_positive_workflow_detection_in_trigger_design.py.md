## 0204. Fix false positive workflow detection in trigger_design.py

### Background

The regex pattern r'first\s+' in trigger_design.py matches 'evaluation-first' causing false positive workflow detection. This causes the skill to incorrectly detect workflow summaries in the description.

### Requirements

Change regex from r'first\s+' to r'\bfirst\s+' to use word boundary. Apply same fix to similar patterns.
