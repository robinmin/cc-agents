## 0198. Update cc-skills SKILL.md and references for new dimensions

### Background

Part of task 0190 (final task). After all new evaluators and scoring changes are implemented, the documentation must be updated to reflect the new 10-dimension evaluation framework, rubric-based scoring, LLM-as-Judge capability, and behavioral test scenario format. This ensures the SKILL.md remains the single source of truth.

Target files: `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills/SKILL.md`, `references/scanner-criteria.md`, `references/evaluation.md`

### Requirements

- [ ] Update SKILL.md "Quality Standards" section: 10 dimensions with new weights
- [ ] Update SKILL.md "Validation Checklist": add trigger design, instruction clarity, value-add, behavioral readiness checks
- [ ] Update `scanner-criteria.md`: document all 10 dimensions with rubric criteria
- [ ] Update `evaluation.md`: add LLM-as-Judge methodology, pass@k metrics, calibration approach
- [ ] Add `references/scenario-schema.md`: document behavioral test scenario format
- [ ] Add `references/rubrics/` directory with rubric YAML files
- [ ] Update Quick Start section if new commands added (e.g., `skills.py test`)
- [ ] Ensure all cross-references between docs are correct
- [ ] All existing tests pass
