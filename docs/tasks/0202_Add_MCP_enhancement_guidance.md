## 0202. Add MCP enhancement guidance

### Background

The official Claude Skills Guide identifies "MCP Enhancement" as Category 3 with specific techniques. cc-skills currently has no guidance for creating skills that enhance MCP tool access.

**Gap identified:** cc-skills covers Technique/Pattern/Reference types but not MCP Enhancement type.

### Requirements

- [ ] Add MCP Enhancement to skill types in SKILL.md
- [ ] Create `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills/references/mcp-integration.md`
- [ ] Document MCP-specific evaluation criteria
- [ ] Add example MCP enhancement skills

### Q&A

Q: Should we create a separate template for MCP Enhancement skills?
A: Yes, similar to technique/pattern/reference templates

### Design

**MCP Enhancement Skill Type:**

```markdown
### MCP Enhancement

Skill that enhances MCP tool access with workflow guidance.

- **Examples:** sentry-code-review, linear-sprint-planning, projecthub-setup
- **Structure:** MCP tool calls, error handling, context enrichment
- **Best for:** Services with MCP servers needing workflow guidance

Key techniques:
- Coordinates multiple MCP calls in sequence
- Embeds domain expertise for the service
- Provides context users would otherwise need to specify
- Error handling for common MCP issues
```

**Reference Content:**

1. **Kitchen Analogy** - MCP = kitchen (tools/ingredients), Skills = recipes (how to use)
2. **When to Create MCP Enhancement Skills**
   - Users don't know what to do after connecting MCP
   - Each conversation starts from scratch
   - Inconsistent results across users
3. **Multi-MCP Coordination Patterns**
   - Phase separation between services
   - Data passing between MCPs
   - Centralized error handling
4. **Error Handling for MCP Issues**
   - Connection refused handling
   - Authentication failures
   - Tool name validation

### Solution

1. Add MCP Enhancement type alongside Technique/Pattern/Reference
2. Create detailed reference for MCP integration patterns
3. Add MCP-specific checklist to validation

### Plan

1. Add MCP Enhancement type to SKILL.md Skill Types section
2. Create `references/mcp-integration.md`
3. Add MCP template: `skill-template-mcp.md`
4. Update init command to support `--type mcp`
5. Add MCP evaluation criteria (future)

### Artifacts

| Type | Path | Generated By | Date |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ | ---- |
| Reference | plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills/references/mcp-integration.md | TBD | TBD |
| Template | plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills/assets/skill-template-mcp.md | TBD | TBD |
