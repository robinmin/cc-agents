## 0203. Add distribution guidance

### Background

The official Claude Skills Guide covers distribution and sharing including GitHub hosting, API usage, and skill positioning. cc-skills has minimal distribution guidance (only `skills.py package` command).

**Gap identified:** cc-skills lacks distribution, API usage, and positioning guidance.

### Requirements

- [ ] Add "Distribution" section to SKILL.md
- [ ] Create `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills/references/distribution.md`
- [ ] Document GitHub hosting best practices
- [ ] Document API usage (`/v1/skills`, `container.skills`)
- [ ] Add positioning guidance (outcomes vs features)

### Q&A

Q: Should API usage be in SKILL.md or references/?
A: Brief mention in SKILL.md, detailed guide in references/distribution.md

### Design

**Distribution Section Content:**

1. **GitHub Hosting (Recommended)**
   - Public repo with clear README (for humans, not AI)
   - Example usage with screenshots
   - Link from MCP documentation
   - Quick-start guide

2. **API Usage**
   ```python
   # Programmatic skill usage
   import anthropic

   client = anthropic.Anthropic()
   response = client.messages.create(
       model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
       container={"skills": ["your-skill-name"]}
   )
   ```

3. **Skill Positioning**
   - Focus on outcomes, not features
   - **Good:** "Set up project workspaces in seconds"
   - **Bad:** "A folder with YAML frontmatter and Markdown instructions"
   - Highlight MCP + skills synergy

4. **Organization-Level Skills**
   - Workspace-wide deployment
   - Centralized management
   - Automatic updates

5. **Installation Guide Template**
   - Download steps
   - Installation steps
   - Testing steps

### Solution

1. Add Distribution section to SKILL.md with quick reference
2. Create detailed references/distribution.md
3. Update package command output to include distribution tips

### Plan

1. Add "Distribution" section to SKILL.md after Quick Reference
2. Create `references/distribution.md`
3. Update `skills.py package` to suggest next steps
4. Add distribution checklist to validation

### Artifacts

| Type | Path | Generated By | Date |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ | ---- |
| Reference | plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills/references/distribution.md | TBD | TBD |
