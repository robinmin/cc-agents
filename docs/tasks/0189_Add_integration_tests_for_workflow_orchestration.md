## 0189. Add integration tests for workflow orchestration

### Background

Task 0185 (enhance super-planner). After creating rd2:workflow-orchestration skill and rewriting super-planner, we need tests to verify: (1) intent-to-workflow mapping works correctly, (2) role assignments are correct per template, (3) super-planner does not use forbidden tools. See brainstorm: docs/.tasks/brainstorm/0185_enhance_super-planner.md

### Requirements

1. Verify intent classification maps keywords to correct workflow templates
2. Verify each workflow template has correct agent assignments per role
3. Verify super-planner agent file does NOT include Read/Write/Edit/Grep/Glob in tools list
4. Verify all 7 workflow templates are defined and complete
5. Test edge cases: ambiguous intent, no matching workflow, missing agents
