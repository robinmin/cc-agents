## 0209. Add dimension weight comments in frontmatter.py/structure.py

### Background

frontmatter.py and structure.py rely on default 0.0 weight without explanation. Need to add clarifying comments.

### Requirements

Add docstring or comment explaining why frontmatter and structure have 0 weight: they are validated in Phase 1 (structural validation) not Phase 2 (quality scoring)

### Q&A

[Clarifications added during planning phase]

### Design

[Architecture/UI specs added by specialists]

### Solution

Added clarifying comments to both files:

**frontmatter.py (line 75-76):**
```python
# Weight 0 - validated in Phase 1 (structural validation), not Phase 2 (quality scoring)
self._weight = DIMENSION_WEIGHTS.get("frontmatter", 0.0)
```

**structure.py (line 84-85):**
```python
# Weight 0 - validated in Phase 1 (structural validation), not Phase 2 (quality scoring)
self._weight = DIMENSION_WEIGHTS.get("structure", 0.0)
```

This clarifies that frontmatter and structure dimensions are validated during Phase 1 (structural validation) and therefore don't contribute to Phase 2 (quality scoring) weighted total.
