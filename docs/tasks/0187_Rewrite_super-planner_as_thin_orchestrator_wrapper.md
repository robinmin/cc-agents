## 0187. Rewrite super-planner as thin orchestrator wrapper

### Background

Task 0185 (enhance super-planner). The current super-planner agent at plugins/rd2/agents/super-planner.md has too many tools (Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob) that tempt it into doing implementation work. It needs to be rewritten as a thin wrapper that delegates to rd2:workflow-orchestration skill for workflow selection and to specialist agents for execution. See brainstorm: docs/.tasks/brainstorm/0185_enhance_super-planner.md

### Requirements

1. Rewrite plugins/rd2/agents/super-planner.md following rd2:cc-agents conventions
2. REMOVE tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob - orchestrator must not touch code
3. KEEP tools: Task, AskUserQuestion, Skill, Bash (for tasks CLI only)
4. Add rd2:workflow-orchestration to skills field in frontmatter
5. Core workflow: invoke Skill(rd2:workflow-orchestration) to get workflow template -> dispatch agents via Task() calls in role order
6. Preserve existing mode system (--auto/--semi/--step) and checkpoint behavior
7. Agent must NEVER implement code, design, review, or research directly
8. Add explicit 'tools restriction' section explaining why only 4 tools are allowed
