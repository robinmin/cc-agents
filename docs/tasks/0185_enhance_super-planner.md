## 0185. enhance super-planner

### Background

After today's enhancement on `rd2:super-planner`, we encountered some new issue: super-planner itself executes some tasks instead of delegating them to the appropriate agents. That's a issue with planner or orchestrator. We need to fix it.

Previous version of `rd2:super-planner` was not a full functional orchestrator but a simple, hard coded planner. We need to fix it. In my original thought, we can implement it in this way:

- Define a set of workflow from simple to complex. Each workflow should be defined as a set of tasks execution sequence with different agents to act as different roles.

- Define a mapping matrix for user intention with these recommended workflows.

- ## Meanwhile, we also enforce all workflows no matter how simple or complex they are, should be executed in this way:
  - Define task scope and priority
  - Define Participants(Agents):
    - rd2:super-planner always acts as orchestrator/leader(mandatory)
    - Someones can act as Pre-production personnel(optionally)
    - Someones can act as Maker(mandatory)
    - Someones can act as Post-production personnel(optionally)
    - Someones can act as Checker(optionally, can be replaced by Maker)
  - orchestrator/leader(rd2:super-planner) **NEVER** hands on any task execution. It's core KPI is ensuring the workflow is executed correctly and efficiently.
  - Based on this generic flow, we can define a set of recommended workflows for different scenarios. For example, coding, testing, research, content creation, etc.

Meanwhile, I also downloaded some other Agent Skills as shown below for your reference:

- vendors/claude-code-subagents-collection/subagents/episode-orchestrator.md
- vendors/claude-code-subagents-collection/subagents/mcp-deployment-orchestrator.md
- vendors/claude-code-subagents-collection/subagents/project-supervisor-orchestrator.md
- vendors/claude-code-subagents-collection/subagents/research-orchestrator.md
- vendors/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/loki-mode/references/tool-orchestration.md

A few points to note:

- These information may be very useful for our task, or totally irrelevant. You need to evaluate them carefully.
- `vendors` is a cache folder temporarily. In case you need some information from it, you should copy out the relevant content instead of adding any reference to it.
- Despite we are enhancing a Subagent `plugins/rd2/agents/super-planner.md`, we also can create a new dedicated Agent skill for orchestrating tasks if needed.
