## 0188. Update tasks-plan command for workflow-aware orchestration

### Background

Task 0185 (enhance super-planner). The /rd2:tasks-plan command at plugins/rd2/commands/tasks-plan.md invokes super-planner. It needs to be updated to support the new workflow-aware orchestration: passing workflow hints, allowing the user to override workflow selection, and properly invoking the rewritten super-planner. See brainstorm: docs/.tasks/brainstorm/0185_enhance_super-planner.md

### Requirements

1. Update plugins/rd2/commands/tasks-plan.md to support --workflow flag (e.g., --workflow coding, --workflow research)
2. If no --workflow flag, super-planner auto-detects from intent
3. Add --list-workflows flag to show available workflow templates
4. Update examples in command file to show workflow-aware usage
5. Ensure backward compatibility: existing /rd2:tasks-plan invocations still work
