## 0186. Create rd2:workflow-orchestration skill

### Background

Task 0185 (enhance super-planner) selected Approach 1: Workflow Template Engine. A new skill rd2:workflow-orchestration will contain: (1) the generic role model (Orchestrator/Pre-production/Maker/Post-production/Checker), (2) workflow template definitions (coding, coding-with-design, research, bugfix, refactor, content, planning-only), (3) intent-to-workflow mapping matrix, (4) execution flow logic. This is the 'fat skill' that super-planner will delegate to. See brainstorm: docs/.tasks/brainstorm/0185_enhance_super-planner.md

### Requirements

1. Create plugins/rd2/skills/workflow-orchestration/SKILL.md following rd2:cc-skills conventions
2. Define the generic role model with 5 roles (Orchestrator, Pre-production, Maker, Post-production, Checker)
3. Define 7 workflow templates (W1-W7) with agent assignments per role
4. Define intent-to-workflow mapping matrix with keyword signals
5. Document execution flow: parse intent -> select template -> assign agents -> execute sequence -> aggregate
6. Include references/ directory for detailed patterns
7. Skill must be knowledge-only (no scripts) - provides workflow definitions that super-planner reads
