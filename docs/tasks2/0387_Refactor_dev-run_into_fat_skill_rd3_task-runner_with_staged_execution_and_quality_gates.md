## 0387. "Refactor dev-run into fat skill rd3:task-runner with staged execution and quality gates"

### Background

## Context

`plugins/rd3/commands/dev-run.md` currently sits at **619 lines** — a clear violation of the project's "Fat Skills, Thin Wrappers" architecture convention. Every other command in `plugins/rd3/commands/` sits between 56-216 lines; existing fat skills cluster around 350-450 lines with a ceiling of 632. The monolithic command embeds the full task-execution workflow directly rather than delegating to a skill.

## Current State

**File:** `plugins/rd3/commands/dev-run.md` (619 lines)

**Embedded workflow:**
- Implement ↔ test loop with optional refine, plan, verify gates
- 4 presets: `simple`, `standard`, `complex`, `research`
- Delegates to 6 underlying skills: `rd3:request-intake`, `rd3:task-decomposition`, `rd3:code-implement-common`, `rd3:sys-testing`, `rd3:code-verification`, `rd3:run-acp`
- Owns task status transitions (pre-implementation, pre-testing, completion guards)
- Handles decomposition handoff contract (batch JSON or one-by-one child creation)
- 5-state machine: `ready → implementing → testing → verifying → done` (+ `blocked`)
- Includes verbose sections on: preflight questions, decomposition paths (A/B), lifecycle bundles, testing evidence ownership, completion guards, channel alias normalization, delegated prompt contracts

## Pain Points Identified

### Architectural violations
1. **Thin-wrapper contract breached** — no corresponding `rd3:dev-run` (or equivalent) skill exists; command is a one-off monolith
2. **Logic duplication** — pre-implementation guards with Design/Plan backfill logic duplicated in 3 places (pre-wip, pre-test, pre-done transitions)
3. **Channel normalization duplicated** — slash-command→ACP-agent mapping table lives in both `dev-run.md` and (implicitly) in `rd3:run-acp`

### Reliability gaps
4. **No retry cap** — docs say "bounded" but give no explicit N for the implement ↔ test loop
5. **Early-report-finish risk** — Stage 4 verification is review-focused, not a completion-proof gate. No post-flight validation that delivery claims match reality.
6. **Decomposition parent-status bug** — `tasks update <WBS> decomposed` normalizes to `Done` in the current `rd3:tasks` CLI, forcing hand-rolled workarounds
7. **No `--dry-run` output schema** — ad-hoc text output, not consumable by schedulers or CI
8. **Opaque `--auto` forwarding** — unclear which sub-skills honor it
9. **`--coverage` only flows to test phase** — no post-verification coverage sanity check

### Missing capabilities
10. **No pre-flight task file quality gate** — no way to validate the task file is structurally complete before execution starts
11. **No staged execution** — schedulers wanting "decompose only" or "implement only after decomposition" paths must run the full workflow or write custom orchestration
12. **Verbose contract details clutter the main file** — batch-create JSON schema, delegated prompt templates, backfill templates, state machine tables all inline rather than in `references/`

## Why Now

- User explicitly flagged the line-count violation and requested the refactor
- Two new features (`--verify`, `--stage`) provide natural extension points; bundling them avoids churn
- Scheduler integration (future cron jobs for decomposition and delayed execution) requires the `--stage` split
- The `decomposed → Done` bug in `rd3:tasks` has been accumulating workarounds; fixing it now prevents further drift


### Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### FR1 — New Skill: `rd3:task-runner`
- Create `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/SKILL.md` as a fat skill (~450 lines target, 500 hard cap)
- Skill owns the full task-execution workflow currently embedded in `dev-run.md`
- Skill name is `task-runner` (NOT `dev-run`) to avoid command/skill namespace collisions on platforms that flatten the two

### FR2 — Thin Command Wrapper
- Rewrite `plugins/rd3/commands/dev-run.md` as a ~60-80 line thin wrapper
- Wrapper delegates to `Skill(skill="rd3:task-runner", args="...")` with argument forwarding
- Wrapper retains public argument surface (backward compatible) plus new options below

### FR3 — New Option: `--preflight-verify`
- When set, insert **Stage 0.5** between Preflight (Stage 0) and Optional Refine (Stage 1)
- Runs `tasks validate <WBS>` (structural completeness check)
- If sections are missing, auto-backfill via existing guard logic (Design/Plan minimum structures)
- If `--auto` is set and validation fails after backfill, halt with actionable error
- If `--auto` is absent and validation fails, prompt user

### FR4 — New Option: `--postflight-verify`
- When set, insert **Stage 5** between Stage 4 (Verify) and `tasks update <WBS> done`
- Executes post-flight completion gate checks (see Section D for enumerated checks)
- If any check fails, leave task in `Testing`, write `## Completion Blockers` section listing failures
- MUST block the `done` transition when any hard check fails

### FR5 — New Option: `--verify`
- Shortcut for `--preflight-verify --postflight-verify` combined
- When used alone without the specific variants, applies both gates

### FR6 — New Option: `--stage <all|plan-only|implement-only>`
- `all` (default): current full workflow — Preflight → Refine → Plan → Implement/Test loop → Verify → Postflight → Done
- `plan-only`: exit cleanly after Stage 2 (Plan + optional decomposition), regardless of whether decomposition occurred. Writes standardized JSON exit envelope (see FR11).
- `implement-only`: skip Stages 1-2 (Refine, Plan). Require pre-populated Design and Plan sections. Enter implement ↔ test loop immediately.
- Preset interactions:
  - `complex` + `implement-only`: warn and continue (trust operator)
  - `research` + `implement-only`: warn and continue
  - `complex` + `plan-only`: valid
  - All other combinations: valid

### FR7 — New Option: `--max-loop-iterations <n>`
- Default: `3`
- Caps the implement → test → implement cycle count
- On exceeding N without convergence, escalate to `rd3:sys-debugging` and set task status to `blocked`

### FR8 — Standardized Dry-Run JSON Schema
- `--dry-run` produces structured JSON via `scripts/dry-run-output.ts`
- Schema includes: workflow shape, stage plan, status transition plan, channel routing
- Schema documented in `references/dry-run-schema.md`

### FR9 — Post-Flight Check Script
- New script: `scripts/postflight-check.ts`
- Runs deterministic checks (git diff, file parsing, timestamp comparison)
- Returns JSON: `{verdict, blockers[], task_status_recommended}`
- Unit tested in `tests/postflight-check.test.ts`
- Callable from agent AND from CI independently

### FR10 — Parent Task Decomposition Status Fix
- Fix upstream bug in `rd3:tasks` CLI: remove `decomposed → Done` normalization
- After decomposition, parent task stays in `WIP` (reuse existing status; NO new status added)
- Parent gets `## Decomposition` section linking child WBS numbers
- Parent transitions to `Done` manually by operator when all children are done (v1 scope; enforcement deferred)

### FR11 — Stage Exit JSON Envelope
- `--stage plan-only` produces standardized JSON on stdout for CI consumption
- Example envelope:
  ```json
  {
    "stage_completed": "plan-only",
    "decomposed": true,
    "child_wbs": ["0274.01", "0274.02"],
    "parent_wbs": "0274",
    "next_recommended_stage": "implement-only",
    "task_status": "WIP"
  }
  ```

### FR12 — References Extraction
- Move verbose content into `references/` files (loaded on demand):
  - `references/status-transitions.md` — guards, backfill templates, state machine
  - `references/decomposition-handoff.md` — paths A/B, batch JSON, parent-task contract
  - `references/channel-delegation.md` — reference-only alias table (execution owned by `run-acp`)
  - `references/delegated-prompts.md` — plan/implement/verify prompt contracts
  - `references/dry-run-schema.md` — JSON output contract for CI
  - `references/postflight-checks.md` — enumerates each check + failure handling

### FR13 — Channel Normalization Deduplication
- Move slash-command→ACP-agent mapping from `task-runner` into `rd3:run-acp` exclusively
- `task-runner` forwards raw channel names; `run-acp` owns normalization
- `references/channel-delegation.md` in task-runner is documentation-only

### FR14 — Status Transition Guard Deduplication
- Extract single `applyGuards(target_status)` helper pattern documented in `references/status-transitions.md`
- Call from each of the 3 transition points (pre-wip, pre-test, pre-done)
- SKILL.md references the helper pattern; does not inline duplicated logic

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1 — Code Quality
- All scripts use shared logger from `scripts/logger.ts` — NO `console.*` calls
- `bun run check` passes (lint + typecheck + test) before each commit
- Code style: 2-space indent, semicolons, double quotes, trailing commas
- TypeScript: `async/await`, `interface` for objects, `type` for unions

### NFR2 — Test Coverage
- Unit tests for both scripts (`dry-run-output.test.ts`, `postflight-check.test.ts`)
- Coverage threshold: project default (90% functions)
- Test location: `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/tests/`

### NFR3 — Backward Compatibility
- Existing `/rd3:dev-run <task-ref>` invocations MUST continue to work
- Default behavior (no new flags) MUST match current dev-run semantics
- No breaking changes to preset names or values
- Current task files in various stages MUST work with new workflow

### NFR4 — Observability
- Dry-run JSON schema enables CI consumption
- Post-flight check JSON envelope enables external monitoring
- Stage exit JSON envelope enables scheduler integration

### NFR5 — Platform Portability
- SKILL.md content platform-agnostic (works across Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, etc.)
- Scripts use Bun.js native APIs first (per project tech stack rules)
- Command wrapper uses Claude Code `Skill()` syntax with platform notes for others

### Q&A



### Design

## Scope

Refactor `plugins/rd3/commands/dev-run.md` (619-line monolith) into a fat skill `rd3:task-runner` with a thin command wrapper. Add `--verify` (pre + post flight), `--stage` (all/plan-only/implement-only), `--max-loop-iterations`, and standardized dry-run JSON. Fix upstream `decomposed → Done` bug in `rd3:tasks`.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Skill Naming
**Choice:** `rd3:task-runner`.
**Rejected alternatives:** `rd3:dev-run` (name collision with command), `rd3:task-coordinator` (implies hierarchy not present), `rd3:task-workflow` (too generic).

### Shape: Single Fat Skill vs Skill-of-Skills
**Choice:** Single fat skill (~450 lines SKILL.md + references/ + scripts/).
**Rejected:** Skill-of-skills pattern (e.g., separate `task-runner-loop`, `task-runner-guards`) — violates project's "skills are leaf capabilities" convention; no current reuse case for sub-skills (YAGNI).

### `--verify` Semantics
**Choice:** Split into three flags:
- `--preflight-verify` = Stage 0.5 (structural validation + backfill)
- `--postflight-verify` = Stage 5 (completion-proof gate)
- `--verify` = shortcut for both

**Rejected:** Single flag fused with refine — different semantics (structural vs behavioral), different failure modes.

### `--stage` Values
**Choice:** `all` | `plan-only` | `implement-only`.
**Rejected:** `before-decompose` / `after-decompose` — implies decomposition always runs; ambiguous for single-task paths.

### Parent Task Status Post-Decomposition
**Choice:** Reuse `WIP`; fix upstream `decomposed → Done` normalization in `rd3:tasks`.
**Rejected:** Adding `Decomposed` or `HandOff` status — expands CLI schema, tests, validators, kanban rendering for small gain.

### Scripts vs Pure Markdown
**Choice:** 2 scripts (`dry-run-output.ts`, `postflight-check.ts`) for deterministic work; everything else markdown.
**Rationale:** Schema enforcement and mechanical checks (git, timestamps) warrant code; workflow logic and prompts stay declarative.

## Boundaries Affected

### Files Created
- `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/scripts/dry-run-output.ts`
- `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/scripts/postflight-check.ts`
- `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/tests/dry-run-output.test.ts`
- `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/tests/postflight-check.test.ts`
- `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/references/status-transitions.md`
- `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/references/decomposition-handoff.md`
- `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/references/channel-delegation.md`
- `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/references/delegated-prompts.md`
- `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/references/dry-run-schema.md`
- `plugins/rd3/skills/task-runner/references/postflight-checks.md`

### Files Modified
- `plugins/rd3/commands/dev-run.md` (619 → ~80 lines; thin wrapper)
- `plugins/rd3/skills/tasks/` (remove `decomposed → Done` normalization)
- `plugins/rd3/skills/run-acp/SKILL.md` (absorb channel normalization ownership)

### Interfaces
- New CLI flags on `/rd3:dev-run`: `--preflight-verify`, `--postflight-verify`, `--verify`, `--stage`, `--max-loop-iterations`
- New JSON schema: dry-run output, stage exit envelope, postflight-check verdict
- Changed behavior: `tasks update <WBS> decomposed` no longer coerces to `Done`

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Breaking existing task executions during refactor | Medium | PR 1 is mechanical move only; zero behavior change |
| Upstream fix in `rd3:tasks` affects other consumers | Medium | Grep for `decomposed` references across codebase; verify no other reliance |
| Post-flight gate blocks legitimate completions | Low | Log-only in v1 unless hard failure; enforcement tunable via flag |
| SKILL.md line count creeps back above 500 | Low | References/ absorb growth; PR review enforces cap |
| Script complexity beyond test coverage | Low | Both scripts ≥90% function coverage; deterministic inputs |
| Namespace collision on non-Claude-Code platforms | Low | Skill named `task-runner`, not `dev-run`; install scripts rewrite colons to hyphens |



### Solution

## High-Level Approach

Single fat skill `rd3:task-runner` with scripts for deterministic checks, plus thin command wrapper `dev-run.md`. Verbose contract details extracted to `references/`. Upstream bug in `rd3:tasks` fixed to eliminate decomposition workarounds.

## Workflow Stages (Updated)

```
Stage 0:    Preflight (always)
Stage 0.5:  Pre-flight Verify  ← NEW (when --preflight-verify or --verify)
Stage 1:    Optional Refine
Stage 2:    Optional Plan + Decomposition
            ├─ EXIT POINT for --stage plan-only
            │   └─ emit JSON envelope → stop
            └─ continue (default) or skip (--stage implement-only)
Stage 3:    Implement ↔ Test Loop (bounded by --max-loop-iterations)
Stage 4:    Verification Gate
Stage 5:    Post-flight Verify  ← NEW (when --postflight-verify or --verify)
            └─ Completion Blockers written if fails
Final:      tasks update <WBS> done (only if Stage 5 passes or is skipped)
```

## Key Design Decisions

### DD1 — Skill Naming: `rd3:task-runner`
Avoid `rd3:dev-run` collision with `/rd3:dev-run` command. `task-runner` matches naming cadence of `sys-testing`, `code-implement-common`. Verb-led, no confusion with `rd3:orchestration-v2`.

### DD2 — `--verify` Split Into Three Flags
- `--preflight-verify`: pre-flight structural validation + auto-backfill
- `--postflight-verify`: post-flight completion-proof gate
- `--verify`: shortcut for both

**Why split:** different semantics (structural vs behavioral), different stages, different failure modes. Operators may want one without the other.

### DD3 — Post-Flight Gate Closes Early-Report-Finish Loop
Stage 4 (Verify) is review-focused. Stage 5 (Post-flight) validates delivery claims:

| Check | Source |
|-------|--------|
| All required task sections populated | `tasks validate <WBS>` |
| Testing evidence not stale | Timestamp vs last code change |
| Verification verdict = `PASS` (not `PARTIAL`) | Stage 4 output |
| Code changes exist | `git diff` non-empty |
| No uncommitted unrelated drift | `git status` on expected paths |
| Coverage threshold met if set | Re-read test evidence |
| Delegated evidence reconciled | Parse delegated outputs in task |

### DD4 — Stage Rename for Clarity
`before-decompose` / `after-decompose` → `plan-only` / `implement-only`. Cleaner in CI logs, symmetric with existing `--mode review-only` in dev-verify. Semantics independent of whether decomposition actually happens.

### DD5 — Parent Status Reuses `WIP`
Don't add `Decomposed` / `HandOff` statuses. Fix upstream: remove `decomposed → Done` normalization in `rd3:tasks`. Parent stays `WIP` with `## Decomposition` section linking children. Transition to `Done` is manual for v1.

### DD6 — Scripts Earn Their Keep Only When Deterministic
Two scripts (`dry-run-output.ts`, `postflight-check.ts`) chosen because:
- Output shape enforcement (dry-run JSON schema can't drift)
- Mechanical checks (git, timestamps, file parsing) — deterministic, testable, CI-reusable

NOT scripted:
- Status transition guards — declarative, agent reasoning fine
- Channel normalization — belongs in `rd3:run-acp`
- Retry loop — agent owns iteration
- Decomposition JSON batch — `tasks batch-create --from-json` already exists

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Breaking existing task executions | PR 1 is mechanical only; behavior unchanged |
| Upstream bug fix affects other consumers | Search `rd3:tasks` callers; verify no other code relies on `decomposed → Done` |
| Post-flight gate too strict, blocks legitimate work | Make informational in v1; enforcement deferred until real failure modes observed |
| Skill line count creeps back | References files absorb growth; 500-line hard cap enforced in PR review |
| Test coverage drops | Both scripts require ≥90% function coverage before merge |

## Out of Scope (Deferred)

- `--resume` capability (C3) — defer until failure frequency justifies
- Telemetry event hooks (C4) — defer until external consumer identified
- Parallel decomposition execution (C8) — merge conflict risk outweighs benefit
- Auto-enforce "all children done before parent done" — informational in v1
- New task status (`Decomposed` / `HandOff`) — reuse `WIP` instead

- [ ] Update command wrapper examples
- [ ] Run each new flag combination on real tasks (smoke test)
- [ ] `bun run check` passes
- [ ] Commit: `feat(task-runner): add --verify, --stage, and --max-loop-iterations options`

## PR 4 — Upstream Bug Fix in `rd3:tasks`

- [ ] Locate `decomposed → Done` normalization logic in `plugins/rd3/skills/tasks/`
- [ ] Remove or correct normalization so `decomposed` is rejected/ignored (parent stays WIP)
- [ ] Update `rd3:tasks` unit tests to reflect new behavior
- [ ] Grep for other callers of `decomposed` status; confirm no regressions
- [ ] Remove workarounds from `task-runner`'s `references/decomposition-handoff.md`
- [ ] Add integration test: decompose task → verify parent stays `WIP`
- [ ] Document parent `Done` transition is manual for v1
- [ ] `bun run check` passes
- [ ] Commit: `fix(tasks): preserve parent WIP status after decomposition`

## PR 5 — Cleanup (D1-D5)

- [ ] Extract `applyGuards(target_status)` helper pattern
  - Document in `references/status-transitions.md`
  - Reference from SKILL.md instead of inlining
- [ ] Move channel normalization table fully into `rd3:run-acp`
  - `references/channel-delegation.md` becomes reference-only
  - SKILL.md forwards raw channel names
- [ ] Pass `--coverage` threshold to `rd3:code-verification` for post-verification check
- [ ] Confirm delegated prompt templates live only in `references/delegated-prompts.md`
- [ ] Render 5-state machine as table in `references/status-transitions.md`
- [ ] Add "Dogfood rule" to SKILL.md and command wrapper:
  - Force `--channel current` when modifying verification/run-acp skills
- [ ] Final line-count audit: SKILL.md ≤500, command ≤100
- [ ] `bun run check` passes
- [ ] Commit: `refactor(task-runner): deduplicate guards, prompts, and channel logic`

## Post-Implementation Verification

- [ ] All 5 PRs merged
- [ ] End-to-end test: run 2 complex tasks through full new workflow
- [ ] End-to-end test: run 1 task with `--stage plan-only` and verify JSON envelope
- [ ] End-to-end test: run 1 task with `--stage implement-only` after decomposition
- [ ] End-to-end test: intentionally incomplete task blocked by `--postflight-verify`
- [ ] Documentation review: all 6 reference files accurate and current
- [ ] Update `MEMORY.md` with any architecture decisions worth persisting
