## 0071. create new Agent Skills cc-hooks and its complementary subagents

### Background

Following the same methodology, principles and architecture of `rd2:cc-agents` and `rd2:cc-skills`, we need to create a new Agent Skills `rd2:cc-hooks` and its complementary subagents into the following places:

- plugins/rd2/skills/cc-hooks : The Agent Skills itself
- plugins/rd2/agents/hook-expert.md : The relevant subagents
- plugins/rd2/agents/hook-doctor.md : The relevant subagents

The all information sources are from the source code of official plugin `plugin-dev` under folder `vendors/claude-code/plugins/plugin-dev`, including:

- vendors/claude-code/plugins/plugin-dev/skills/hook-development

### Requirements / Objectives

Base the original source from `vendors/claude-code/plugins/plugin-dev/skills/hook-development`, you should:

- Invoke `rd2:skill-doctor` and `rd2:skill-expert` to create the new Agent Skills `rd2:cc-hooks` into `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-hooks`
- Invoke `rd2:agent-doctor` and `rd2:agent-expert` to create and refine the relevant subagents into `plugins/rd2/agents/hook-expert.md` and `plugins/rd2/agents/hook-doctor.md`

> **Note:** Track all generated files from specialists and implementation:
>
> - Architecture specs, diagrams, design mockups
> - Implementation files (code, configs, tests)
> - Documentation updates
