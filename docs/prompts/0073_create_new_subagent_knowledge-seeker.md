## 0073. create new subagent knowledge-seeker

### Background

We already have a Agent Skills `rd2:knowledge-extraction` which located in `plugins/rd2/skills/knowledge-extraction`. Its previous name was `rd2:knowledge-seeker`, but we already renamed it to `rd2:knowledge-extraction` to avoid confusion.

I also created a new subagent `rd2:knowledge-seeker` which located in `plugins/rd2/subagents/knowledge-seeker` by '/rd2:agent-add rd2 knowledge-seeker'.

### Requirements / Objectives

I need your help to fine-tune `rd2:knowledge-seeker` as a dedicated subagent to extract specified information from a given resource (file path, URL, or direct inputs) with cross validation.

### Solutions / Goals
