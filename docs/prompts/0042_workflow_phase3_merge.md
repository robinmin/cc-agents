# Phase 3: Merge into SKILL.md

## Objective

Integrate verified techniques into the existing anti-hallucination SKILL.md.

## Tasks

1. **Read** existing SKILL.md
2. **Identify** gaps where new techniques fit
3. **Add** new techniques with citations
4. **Maintain** structure under 500 lines
5. **Preserve** existing working content

## Integration Strategy

- Keep existing verification workflow (it works)
- Add research-backed techniques
- Add new categories if needed
- Update confidence scoring based on research
- Use progressive disclosure if needed

## Constraints

- Max 500 lines
- Focus on prompt engineering + simple scripts
- Only integrate verify-success sources
- Maintain citation format

## Expected Output

- Updated SKILL.md content
- Diff showing changes
- Line count verification
- Summary of new techniques added

## Deliverables

1. Validation status report (16 sources)
2. Final integrated techniques (de-duplicated)
3. Updated SKILL.md content
