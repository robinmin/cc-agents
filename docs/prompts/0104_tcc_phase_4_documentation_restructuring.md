## 0104. TCC Phase 4 - Documentation Restructuring

### Background

The technical-content-creation SKILL.md is ~295 lines. Following the progressive disclosure pattern applied to image skills, the core SKILL.md should be lean (~200-250 lines) with detailed content moved to references/ files. This improves token efficiency and user experience.

### Requirements

**Deliverables:**

1. **Create `references/workflows.md`**
   - 8+ step-by-step workflow examples:
     1. Complete end-to-end workflow
     2. Quick blog post (skip illustrations)
     3. Research-heavy article (systematic review)
     4. Tutorial with code examples
     5. Opinion piece (narrative outline)
     6. Multi-platform publishing
     7. Revision workflow
     8. Batch content creation
   - Each workflow: Use case, Prerequisites, Steps, Expected output

2. **Create `references/troubleshooting.md`**
   - Repository issues (TCC_REPO_ROOT, collection not found)
   - Stage-specific issues (0-6)
   - Configuration issues
   - Image skill integration issues
   - Common error messages with solutions
   - Debug mode instructions

3. **Restructure SKILL.md**
   - Target: ~200-250 lines (down from ~295)
   - Keep: Frontmatter, Overview, When to Use, Quick Start (condensed), Stage Mapping Table, Integration Points, References section
   - Move to references/:
     - Stage 2 multi-option details → references/outline-multi-option.md
     - Complete workflow example → references/workflows.md
     - Detailed troubleshooting → references/troubleshooting.md

4. **Add SKILL.md References section**
   ```markdown
   ## References

   ### Reference Files
   - **`references/stage-details.md`** - Detailed stage specifications
   - **`references/outline-multi-option.md`** - Stage 2 multi-option workflow
   - **`references/workflows.md`** - Step-by-step workflow examples
   - **`references/troubleshooting.md`** - Common issues and solutions
   - **`references/platform-guide.md`** - Platform adaptation specifications
   - **`references/error-reference.md`** - Error handling quick reference

   ### Example Files
   - **`examples/complete-workflow/`** - Full end-to-end example
   ```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- SKILL.md reduced to ~200-250 lines
- workflows.md has 8+ complete workflows
- troubleshooting.md covers all 7 stages
- References section properly links all files
- Progressive disclosure pattern followed

### Q&A

[Clarifications added during planning phase]

### Design

[Architecture/specs added by specialists]

### Plan

1. Create references/workflows.md with 8+ workflows
2. Create references/troubleshooting.md
3. Restructure SKILL.md (move content, condense sections)
4. Add References section to SKILL.md
5. Verify all links are correct
6. Check word count and token efficiency

### Artifacts

| Type | Path | Generated By | Date |
|------|------|--------------|------|
| Reference | references/workflows.md | Phase 4 | |
| Reference | references/troubleshooting.md | Phase 4 | |
| Restructured | SKILL.md | Phase 4 | |

### References

- Progressive disclosure pattern from image skills
- Existing references: stage-details.md, platform-guide.md, error-reference.md
