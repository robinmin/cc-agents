## 0178. test all publish-to- agent skills one by one

### Background
I've develop a set of publish-to-* Agent Skills with their scripts in plugin wt. I want to test them one by one to make sure they work as expected. It including:
- publish-to-surfing
- publish-to-x
- publish-to-wechatmp
- publish-to-juejin
- publish-to-qiita
- publish-to-zenn
- publish-to-infoq
- publish-to-medium
- publish-to-substack
- publish-to-xhs

Within it, as `publish-to-surfing` is used to publish material to my selfhosted website with different tech stack, it's not in current scope.  And `publish-to-x` and `publish-to-wechatmp` are already tested and working despite some issues, so you can skip them. We will deal with both of them later after we tested all the other skills.

Meanwhile, I already prepared a set of test materials with different languages in folder `~/tcc/repo/collections/macos/overview-of-macos-process-automation-methods/6-publish`. You can see the following list for details:

- article_cn.md ## Chinese version
- article_en.md ## English version
- article_ja.md ## Japanese version

We need to test each skill with the following matrix:

| Skill | Language | Expected Result |
|------|------|------|
| publish-to-juejin | Chinese |  |
| publish-to-infoq | Chinese |  |
| publish-to-xhs | Chinese |  |
| publish-to-qiita | Japanese |  |
| publish-to-zenn | Japanese |  |
| publish-to-medium | English |  |
| publish-to-substack | English |  |


And we use `~/.claude/wt/config.jsonc` as the global config file for plugin `wt`. You can find the relevant configgiration for current agent skill in `~/.claude/wt/config.jsonc` in its [agent-skill-name] section. For example, you can find the relevant configgiration for `publish-to-juejin` in `~/.claude/wt/config.jsonc` in its `[publish-to-juejin]` section.

We already implemented web browser profile caching for `publish-to-*` agent skills. When we login to a website for the first time, we will use the web browser to login and save the profile. Then, we will use the cached profile to login in the future. If you fint current agent skill is not implemented in this way, you need to report it to me and we will deal with it later.

### Requirements

Test with these agent skills and scripts to these platforms one by one. In case of any issues, you need to report it to me and we will deal with it later.
