## 0071. create new Agent Skills cc-commands and its complementary subagents and slash commands

### Background

Following the same methodology, principles and architecture of `rd2:cc-agents` and `rd2:cc-skills`, we need to create a new Agent Skills `rd2:cc-commands` and its complementary subagents and slash commands into the following places:

- plugins/rd2/skills/cc-commands : The Agent Skills itself
- plugins/rd2/agents/command-expert.md : The relevant subagents
- plugins/rd2/agents/command-doctor.md : The relevant subagents
- plugins/rd2/commands/command-add.md : The relevant slash commands
- plugins/rd2/commands/command-evaluate.md : The relevant slash commands
- plugins/rd2/commands/command-refine.md : The relevant slash commands

The all information sources are from the source code of official plugin `plugin-dev` under folder `vendors/claude-code/plugins/plugin-dev`, including:

- vendors/claude-code/plugins/plugin-dev/skills/command-development

Meanwhile, according to previous experience, I added a new section "Hybrid Approach for Complex Commands / Subagents" into `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. To ensure it will be treated as a common rule to customize and fine-tune these complex slash commands or subagents, I need your help to absorb this as a concise and precise rule into `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-commands/SKILL.md`.

Additionally, I already prepared a additional reference file in `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-agents/references/ClaudeCodeBuilt-inTools.md`, which contains a comprehensive list of Claude Code built-in tools and their usage examples for reference. You can copy it as `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-commands/references/ClaudeCodeBuilt-inTools.md`, then add a reference to this file in `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-commands/SKILL.md`.

### Requirements / Objectives

Base the original source from `vendors/claude-code/plugins/plugin-dev/skills/command-development`, you should:

- Invoke `rd2:skill-doctor` and `rd2:skill-expert` to create the new Agent Skills `rd2:cc-commands` into `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-commands`
- Invoke `rd2:agent-doctor` and `rd2:agent-expert` to create and refine the relevant subagents into `plugins/rd2/agents/command-expert.md` and `plugins/rd2/agents/command-doctor.md`
- Based on `plugins/rd2/agents/command-expert.md` and `plugins/rd2/agents/command-doctor.md`, create the following slash commands as a simple wrappers:
  - plugins/rd2/commands/command-add.md
  - plugins/rd2/commands/command-evaluate.md
  - plugins/rd2/commands/command-refine.md

### Solutions / Goals

> **Note:** All implementation completed successfully following the rd2:cc-agents and rd2:cc-skills methodology.

**Implementation Summary:**
- Created `rd2:cc-commands` skill with proper structure, progressive disclosure, and evaluation framework
- Created `command-expert` agent for command creation (following agent-expert.md pattern)
- Created `command-doctor` agent for command quality evaluation (following agent-doctor.md pattern)
- Created three slash commands as thin wrappers: `command-add`, `command-evaluate`, `command-refine`
- Copied reference files from plugin-dev/command-development
- Integrated the "Hybrid Approach for Complex Commands / Subagents" rule into SKILL.md
- Added ClaudeCodeBuilt-inTools.md reference to SKILL.md
