# Phase 2: Technique Integration

## Objective

Extract prompt-engineering techniques from verified sources and de-duplicate overlapping methods.

## Tasks

1. **Extract techniques** from all verify-success sources
2. **De-duplicate** overlapping methods
3. **Organize** into categories:
   - Detection techniques
   - Mitigation techniques
   - Workflow protocols
4. **Filter** for prompt-based + simple script approaches only

## Categories

### Detection
- Self-verification prompts
- Consistency checks
- Confidence scoring
- Fact-checking workflows

### Mitigation
- Chain-of-thought variations
- Few-shot patterns
- Retrieval-augmented generation
- Uncertainty expression

### Workflow
- Verification before generation
- Multi-step validation
- Human-in-the-loop patterns

## Expected Output

- De-duplicated technique list
- Categorized by Detection/Mitigation/Workflow
- Source citations for each technique
- Prioritized by practical applicability

## Next Phase

Phase 3: Merge into SKILL.md
