## 0070. fine tune Agent Skills cc-skills

### Background

I downloaded the official plugin 'plugin-dev' into `vendors/claude-code/plugins/plugin-dev`. We can learn from it to improve our knowledge of how to develop and customize agents from the following resources:

- vendors/claude-code/plugins/plugin-dev/agents/skill-reviewer.md
- vendors/claude-code/plugins/plugin-dev/skills/skill-development

### Requirements / Objectives

- Review the contents of `vendors/claude-code/plugins/plugin-dev/skills/skill-development` to ensure all these valuable information are included in our Agent Skills in `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills`. In case of any conflicts, we will accept it to overwrite the existing content as they're from the official plugin 'plugin-dev'. Our goal is to ensure our Agent Skills `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills` is accurate and up-to-date and made it as a great Agent Skills. You maybe need to invoke `rd:super-researcher` to help you with this task if needed.

- Then we need to fine tune `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills/SKILL.md` to ensure it's accurate and up-to-date and made it as a great Agent Skills. In case of any too detailed information but still valuable, we will consider extracting it to its complementary files under `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills/references`.

- With the same approach, we can extract the relevant valuable information from `vendors/claude-code/plugins/plugin-dev/agents/skill-reviewer.md` to `plugins/rd2/agents/skill-doctor.md` and `plugins/rd2/agents/skill-expert.md` if needed. The goal is also to ensure that the contents of these files are accurate and up-to-date and made both of them are great subagents.

### Q&A

[Clarifications from user, decisions made during implementation]

**Q: Should we preserve the existing cc-skills content or completely replace it?**
**A:** We merged the official content while preserving our unique aspects like scripts.py workflow, evaluation-first development, and fat skills pattern. The official content supplements rather than replaces.

**Q: What content should be extracted to references/?**
**A:** Detailed writing style requirements, validation checklist, common mistakes, and quick reference patterns were extracted to keep SKILL.md lean and follow progressive disclosure.

### Implementation Summary

**Phase 1 - cc-skills/SKILL.md Updates:**
- Updated workflow steps to match official 6-step process
- Added Step 1: Understanding with Concrete Examples (with example questions)
- Added Step 2: Plan Reusable Contents (with analysis patterns)
- Added Step 3: Create Skill Structure (plugin-specific)
- Added comprehensive Writing Style Requirements section
- Added Validation Checklist section
- Added Common Mistakes to Avoid section (4 mistakes with examples)
- Added Quick Reference section (Minimal/Standard/Complete patterns)

**Phase 2 - New Reference Files:**
- Created `references/writing-style.md` - Detailed writing style guide with examples
- Created `references/validation-checklist.md` - Comprehensive validation checklist
- Created `references/common-mistakes.md` - 4 common mistakes with before/after examples
- Created `references/quick-reference.md` - Quick reference patterns and templates

**Phase 3 - Agent Updates:**
- Updated `skill-doctor.md` with detailed review process from skill-reviewer.md
- Added quality standards and output format details
- Updated `skill-expert.md` with official 6-step creation process
- Added concrete example gathering methodology

**Result:** cc-skills, skill-doctor, and skill-expert are now aligned with official plugin-dev best practices while maintaining our unique features.
