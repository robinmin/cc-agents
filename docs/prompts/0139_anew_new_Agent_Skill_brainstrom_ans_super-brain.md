## 0139. Implement rd2:brainstorm skill with task-based workflow

### Background

We always need to brainstorm new ideas and solutions to improve our products and services. I used superpowers:brainstorm very well, but it's not customized for tasks file based workflows. I need to create a new agent skill that can generate ideas and solutions based on the our task file based workflows: It accepts a issue description or a task file path as the input. By the end of this task, it generates a list of ideas and solutions and provide a option to convert all of them or some of them into new created task files for further execution. These file creation and task files' status management is handled by `tasks` CLI.

### Requirements / Objectives

**Functional Requirements:**
- Accept issue description or task file path as input
- Generate list of ideas and solutions with research
- Provide option (via AskUserQuestion) to convert ideas into task files
- Integrate with tasks CLI for task creation and management

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Use anti-hallucination protocol for research
- Support two input modes (file path vs description)
- Generate 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
- Always cite sources with confidence levels

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] rd2:brainstorm skill created with 4-phase workflow
- [x] super-brain agent updated with proper format
- [x] /rd2:tasks-brainstorm command created
- [x] Input Processing phase implemented
- [x] Research & Ideation phase implemented
- [x] Structured Output phase implemented
- [x] Task Creation phase implemented
- [x] Anti-hallucination protocol integrated
- [x] Task CLI integration complete

### Q&A

**Q:** Should we reference superpowers:brainstorm?
**A:** No, embed the brainstorming logic directly into rd2:brainstorm skill.

**Q:** How do we determine what's "task-worthy"?
**A:** Items that are concrete action items, have clear objectives, and can be executed independently.

### Design

**Architecture:**

1. **rd2:brainstorm (Fat Skill)** - `plugins/rd2/skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md`
   - 4-phase workflow: Input Processing → Research & Ideation → Structured Output → Task Creation
   - Anti-hallucination protocol integration
   - Tool priority: ref → WebSearch → wt:super-researcher

2. **super-brain (Subagent)** - `plugins/rd2/agents/super-brain.md`
   - Follows full cc-agents template format
   - Delegates to rd2:brainstorm skill
   - Coordinates task CLI integration

3. **/rd2:tasks-brainstorm (Slash Command)** - `plugins/rd2/commands/tasks-brainstorm.md`
   - Thin wrapper for human invocation
   - Smart positional detection for file path vs description
   - Delegates to super-brain agent

### Implementation Summary

**Phase 1: Input Processing (Task 0140)** ✅
- Created `/Users/robin/projects/cc-agents/plugins/rd2/skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md`
- Input type detection (file path vs issue description)
- Task file reading with frontmatter parsing
- Context extraction and validation

**Phase 2: Research & Ideation (Task 0141)** ✅
- Anti-hallucination protocol integrated
- Tool priority: ref_search_documentation → WebSearch → wt:super-researcher
- 2-3 approach generation with trade-offs
- Confidence scoring and source citation

**Phase 3: Structured Output (Task 0142)** ✅
- Markdown generation with Overview, Approaches, Recommendations, Next Steps
- Section presentation (200-300 words) with confirmation
- File saving to docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-brainstorm.md

**Phase 4: Task Creation (Task 0143)** ✅
- Task-worthy item extraction
- AskUserQuestion for confirmation ("Create all", "Create some", "Skip")
- Batch task creation via tasks CLI
- Kanban board refresh
- Completion report with WBS numbers and file paths
