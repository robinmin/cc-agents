## 0177. Enhance unit tests for WT publish-to-* skills to 85%+ coverage and 100% pass

### Background

User requested enhancement of unit tests for 10 WT publishing skills to achieve at least 85% coverage and 100% pass rate.

### Current Status Assessment

**Test Status Summary (as of 2026-02-08):**
- `publish-to-medium`: 41 pass / 0 fail ✓ (100% pass)
- `publish-to-x`: 17 fail / 2 errors (0% pass)
- `publish-to-wechatmp`: 28 fail (0% pass)
- `publish-to-juejin`: 3 fail / 3 errors
- `publish-to-infoq`: 2 fail / 2 errors
- `publish-to-xhs`: 3 fail / 3 errors
- `publish-to-substack`: 2 fail / 2 errors
- `publish-to-surfing`: NO TESTS (0% coverage)
- `publish-to-zenn`: 2 fail / 2 errors
