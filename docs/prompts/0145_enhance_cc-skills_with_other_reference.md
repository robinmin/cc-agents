## 0145. enhance cc-skills with other reference

### Background

To enable us to enhance our meta skills(in `plugins/rd2/skills/cc-skills`) with other references, I identify two sources:

- [Anthropic Official meta Skill](vendors/skills/skills/skill-creator)
- [Famous superpowers' writing skills](vendors/superpowers/skills/writing-skills)

As this is the meta Agent Skills, is very important to ensure that the enhancements are done in a way that is consistent with the overall design and architecture of the system. Meanwhile, precise and consistent implementation is crucial to maintain the quality and reliability of the system. And, Do not forget our rule on reference from @vendors folder, as they will be removed soon later:

```text
**Never refer to the sample folder `vendors`**: Folder `vendors` is a reference for development purposes only, never refer to it in your code.
```

### Requirements

Act as a master of prompt engineering and Claude Code itself. I need you:

- conduct a comprehensive analysis on both sources and provide a detailed report on how to create and ensure a high quality Agent Skills.
- Use web search or mcp ref or other tools to do cross verification and ensure the accuracy of the information.
- Then deduplicate the information to ensure consistency and accuracy with our existing meta skills, and add the remaining information to enhance our meta skills.
- As subagents `rd2:skill-expert` and `rd2:skill-doctor` are built on this Agent Skills, so we **CANNOT** use them to evaluate and refine itself to avoid bad experience legal issues.

### Q&A

**Q:** Should we use rd2:skill-expert or rd2:skill-doctor?
**A:** No, these agents are built on cc-skills and cannot be used to evaluate/refine themselves.

**Q:** Can we reference vendors/ folder in the final implementation?
**A:** No, all content must be extracted and internalized. vendors/ is reference-only.

### Design

**Gap Analysis Summary:**

12 enhancement opportunities identified from cross-analysis:

| Priority | Feature | Source | Confidence |
|----------|---------|--------|------------|
| P1 | Claude Search Optimization (CSO) | Superpowers | HIGH |
| P2 | Degrees of Freedom concept | Anthropic | HIGH |
| P3 | Skill Types categorization | Superpowers | MEDIUM |
| P4 | What NOT to Include section | Anthropic | HIGH |
| P5 | TDD for Skills reference | Superpowers | MEDIUM |

**Implementation Strategy:** Comprehensive Enhancement
- Add new sections to SKILL.md for core concepts
- Create new reference files for detailed guidance
- Maintain progressive disclosure (keep SKILL.md lean)

See detailed brainstorm: [docs/plans/2026-01-31-cc-skills-enhancement-brainstorm.md](../plans/2026-01-31-cc-skills-enhancement-brainstorm.md)

### Plan

Execute subtasks in priority order:

1. **Task 0140** - Add CSO section (description optimization, keyword coverage, token targets)
2. **Task 0141** - Add Degrees of Freedom (high/medium/low specificity guidance)
3. **Task 0142** - Add Skill Types (Technique/Pattern/Reference categorization)
4. **Task 0143** - Add What NOT to Include (explicit exclusion list)
5. **Task 0144** - Add TDD for Skills (optional advanced methodology in references/)
