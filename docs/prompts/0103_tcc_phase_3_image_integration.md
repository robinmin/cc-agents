## 0103. TCC Phase 3 - Image Skill Integration

### Background

The wt plugin has enhanced image skills (image-generate 95/100, image-cover 99.3/100, image-illustrator 92/100) with progressive disclosure and comprehensive features. The technical-content-creation skill's Stages 4 (Illustration) and 5 (Adaptation) should integrate these skills instead of using generic image generation commands.

### Requirements

**Deliverables:**

1. **Update `references/stage-details.md`**
   - Add Stage 4 image skill integration examples:
     - Generate inline illustration: `wt:image-illustrator`
     - Generate article cover: `wt:image-cover`
     - Generate custom image: `wt:image-generate`
   - Update Stage 5 adaptation to reference image outputs
   - Add context file examples for image generation
   - Include resolution and style mapping

2. **Update SKILL.md Integration Points section**
   - Add wt:image-generate entry with use case
   - Add wt:image-cover entry with use case
   - Add wt:image-illustrator entry with use case
   - Update Stage 4 description to reference image skills
   - Update Stage 5 description for image-aware adaptation

3. **Update integration tests**
   - Test Stage 4 with wt:image-cover
   - Test Stage 4 with wt:image-generate
   - Test Stage 4 with wt:image-illustrator
   - Verify captions.json compatibility
   - Verify image outputs in 4-illustration/

**Integration Examples:**

```bash
# Cover generation
wt:image-cover --article 3-draft/draft-article.md --output 4-illustration/cover.png

# Inline illustration
wt:image-illustrator --article 3-draft/draft-article.md \
  --image-dir 4-illustration/images/ --min-positions 3

# Custom image
wt:image-generate "Architecture diagram" --style technical-diagram
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Stage 4 documentation references all 3 image skills
- Stage 5 documentation mentions image outputs
- Integration tests pass with image skills
- Image skills properly integrated into workflow
