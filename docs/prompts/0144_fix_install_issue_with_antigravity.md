## 0138. fix install issue with antigravity

### Background

Despite we already used rulesync to develop a set of scripts(scripts/setup-all.sh and others), unfortunately, I confirmed that it's not working properly with antigravity. We need to use the same framework to customize another workable script to fix the issue.

According to my research result of how to mapping Claude Code Plugin components to Antogravity for your reference:

- Global Workflows(Subagents + Slash Commands): ~/.gemini/antigravity/global_workflows/
- Workspace Workflows(Subagents + Slash Commands): [your-workspace]/.agent/workflows/
- Global Skills(Agent Skills): ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/ (Note: some systems may resolve this as /global_skills/)

As Workflows folder only allow markdown files, we need to rename all subagents and slash commands markdown files with plugin name as prefix.

### Requirements

#### Renaming Rules

- New file name in Workflows folder should be composed as '[plugin_name]_[subagent_name].md' or '[plugin_name]_[slash_command_name].md'. That means, for `rd2:skill-expert` will be renamed to `rd2_skill-expert.md`.

- As Antigravity support Agent Skills, we just need to add plugin name as prefix to Agent Skills to avoid conflicts. For example, `rd2:cc-skills` will be renamed to `rd2_cc-skills`.

#### Customize `scripts/tools/antigravity.sh` or some other script

- Copy and rename all subagents and slash commands for plugin rd2 and plugin wt markdown files with plugin name as prefix into Global Workflows folder ~/.gemini/antigravity/global_workflows/;
- Copy and rename all Agent Skills for plugin rd2 and plugin wt with plugin name as prefix into Workspace Workflows folder [your-workspace]/.agent/workflows/;
- Copy and rename all Agent Skills for plugin rd2 and plugin wt markdown files with plugin name as prefix into Global Skills folder ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/;
