## 0160. Performance Testing

### Background

Performance is critical for user experience. The rd2:tasks skill must complete operations quickly:

- **User Expectation**: Commands should respond in under 500ms
- **Tool Overhead**: Claude Code tool calls have inherent latency
- **File I/O**: File system operations should be optimized
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching can reduce repeated work

This task ensures performance requirements are met and maintained.

### Requirements

1. **Performance Benchmarks**:
   - Create command: <500ms
   - List command: <300ms
   - Update command: <500ms
   - Refresh command: <1000ms
2. **Load Testing**: Performance under load (multiple concurrent commands)
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor and optimize memory consumption
4. **Profiling**: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks
5. **Regression Tests**: Detect performance regressions in CI

### Q&A

[Clarifications to be added during planning phase]

### Design

[Architecture specs to be added by specialists]

### Plan

1. Set up performance benchmarking framework
2. Benchmark current baseline performance
3. Profile to identify bottlenecks
4. Optimize identified bottlenecks
5. Re-benchmark to verify improvements
6. Set up performance regression tests in CI
7. Document performance characteristics
