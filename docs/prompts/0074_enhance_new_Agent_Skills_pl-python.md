## 0074. enhance new Agent Skills pl-python

### Background

I just used slash command `/rd2:skill-add rd2 pl-python` to add a new Agent Skills in folder `plugins/rd2/skills/pl-python`.

Meanwhile, we also have some other kind of format for python as shown below. I need your use `rd2:knowledge-seeker` to extract relevant patterns, paradigms, best practices, techniques, and built-in libraries usage for Python programming:

- plugins/rd/agents/python-expert.md
- vendors/dot-claude/skills/code-review/references/python.md
- vendors/claude-code-subagents-collection/subagents/python-expert.md

And, I also need your help to invoke `rd:super-researcher` to find more relevant patterns, paradigms, best practices, techniques, and built-in libraries usage for Python programming for the web.

### Requirements / Objectives

- Use `rd2:knowledge-seeker` to extract relevant patterns, paradigms, best practices, techniques, and built-in libraries usage for Python programming from these given files:
  - plugins/rd/agents/python-expert.md
  - vendors/dot-claude/skills/code-review/references/python.md
  - vendors/claude-code-subagents-collection/subagents/python-expert.md

- Use `rd:super-researcher` to find more relevant patterns, paradigms, best practices, techniques, and built-in libraries usage for Python programming for the web.

- Consolidate these findings into one list, and then do cross verification the list, then filter out irrelevant information.

- Integrate the consolidated findings into file `plugins/rd2/skills/pl-python/SKILL.md`

- Invoke slash commands `/rd2:skill-evaluate` and `/rd2:skill-refine` to evaluate and refine `plugins/rd2/skills/pl-python/SKILL.md` to make it as a more powerful and reliable Agent Skills.

### Solutions / Goals

> **Note:** Specialist outputs (super-architect, super-designer) are added here with attribution:
>
> - Specialist name
> - Completion date
> - Artifacts generated (with file paths)

### Artifacts

> **Note:** Track all generated files from specialists and implementation:
>
> - Architecture specs, diagrams, design mockups
> - Implementation files (code, configs, tests)
> - Documentation updates

| Type | Path | Generated By | Date | Purpose |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ | ---- | ------- |
|      |      |              |      |         |
