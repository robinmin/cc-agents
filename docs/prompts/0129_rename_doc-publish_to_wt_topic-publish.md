## 0129. Rename doc-publish to wt:topic-publish

### Background

The wt plugin is transitioning to a unified `topic-*` namespace for all workflow commands. The `doc-publish` command (Stage 6 of the Technical Content Workflow) needs to be renamed to `wt:topic-publish` for consistency.

This task implements the design from `/Users/robin/projects/cc-agents/docs/plans/2026-01-30-it-writer-agent-redesign.md` which calls for renaming all `doc-*` commands to `topic-*` equivalents.

### Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- Create new command file `/Users/robin/projects/cc-agents/plugins/wt/commands/topic-publish.md`
- Copy content from existing `doc-publish.md` with appropriate updates
- Update all references to reflect new name
- Remove old `doc-publish.md` file

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Maintain backward compatibility (handled in separate task 0131)
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Update internal references to use new command name

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] New command file exists at `plugins/wt/commands/topic-publish.md`
- [ ] Command frontmatter uses `topic-publish` name
- [ ] Command description updated to reflect new naming
- [ ] All examples use `/wt:topic-publish` instead of `/wt:doc-publish`
- [ ] Stage references updated (e.g., "Stage 6: `/wt:topic-publish`")
- [ ] Related commands section references new names
- [ ] Old `doc-publish.md` file removed
- [ ] No broken references to old command name in new file

### Q&A

**Q:** Should I update references in other files?
**A:** No, that's handled by task 0132 (Update documentation/references). This task only creates the new command file and removes the old one.

### Design

**Technology Stack:**
- File copy and rename operation
- Content updates for name consistency

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Read existing `doc-publish.md`
2. Create new `topic-publish.md` with updated content
3. Update all command name references
4. Update examples to use new name
5. Delete old `doc-publish.md`

### Plan

1. **Create New Command File** - Copy and update content
   - [ ] Read `plugins/wt/commands/doc-publish.md`
   - [ ] Create `plugins/wt/commands/topic-publish.md`
   - [ ] Update frontmatter: name, description
   - [ ] Update all `/wt:doc-publish` references to `/wt:topic-publish`
   - [ ] Update Stage references in Related Commands section
   - [ ] Update See Also section if it references the command name
   - [ ] Verify content is complete and accurate
2. **Remove Old File** - Clean up deprecated command
   - [ ] Delete `plugins/wt/commands/doc-publish.md`
