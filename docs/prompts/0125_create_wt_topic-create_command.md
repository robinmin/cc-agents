## 0125. Create wt:topic-create Command

### Background

The wt plugin currently has individual stage commands but lacks a high-level entry point for the complete 7-stage technical content workflow. The `wt:it-writer` agent is mature and production-ready, but users need a convenient slash command that orchestrates the full workflow from materials extraction through publishing.

This task implements the design from `/Users/robin/projects/cc-agents/docs/plans/2026-01-30-it-writer-agent-redesign.md` which calls for a new `wt:topic-create` command as the primary entry point.

### Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- Create `/Users/robin/projects/cc-agents/plugins/wt/commands/topic-create.md` command file
- Command should accept hybrid input (natural language or structured parameters)
- Implement pass-through wrapper pattern with smart defaults
- Support interactive mode with context detection
- Delegate all content creation to `wt:it-writer` agent (agent-centric)
- Support all 7 stages: materials extraction, research, outline, draft, illustration, adaptation, publishing

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Follow existing command structure and frontmatter format
- Include comprehensive examples for common use cases
- Document stage gate behavior (outline approval, draft review, publishing confirmation)
- Include error handling and partial recovery documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Command file exists at `plugins/wt/commands/topic-create.md`
- [ ] Command frontmatter includes description and argument-hint
- [ ] Quick start section with 3+ examples
- [ ] Usage section showing delegation to `wt:it-writer` agent
- [ ] Arguments table with all supported parameters
- [ ] Examples section covering full workflow, research-heavy, opinion piece, tutorial scenarios
- [ ] Related commands section linking to individual stage commands
- [ ] See also section linking to `wt:it-writer` agent and `wt:technical-content-creation` skill
- [ ] Stage gate documentation explaining interactive approval points
- [ ] Error handling examples showing recovery patterns

**Command Specification:**
```yaml
name: topic-create
description: Create technical content with full 7-stage workflow (materials, research, outline, draft, illustrations, adaptation, publishing)
argument-hint: <topic> [--collection <name>] [--style <profile>] [--stages <0-6>] [--platforms <list>] [--illustrations <n>]
```

### Q&A

**Q:** Should this command create the topic folder structure?
**A:** No, that's handled by `wt:topic-init` which should be called first or auto-invoked by the agent.

**Q:** How should the command handle partial stage execution?
**A:** The command should support `--stages` flag to specify which stages to run, with smart defaults based on existing artifacts.

### Design

**Technology Stack:**
- Markdown command file following wt plugin conventions
- Delegation to `wt:it-writer` agent via Task tool
- Pass-through wrapper pattern for arguments

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Review existing command files for structure patterns
2. Create topic-create.md with proper frontmatter
3. Add Quick Start section with 3+ examples
4. Add Usage section showing agent delegation
5. Add Arguments table with all parameters
6. Add Examples section with 4 scenarios
7. Add Stage Gates section explaining interactive approvals
8. Add Error Handling section
9. Add Related Commands section
10. Add See Also section with links

### Plan

1. **Create Command File** - Write topic-create.md with complete documentation
   - [ ] Write frontmatter (name, description, argument-hint)
   - [ ] Write Overview section explaining 7-stage workflow
   - [ ] Write Quick Start section with 3+ examples
   - [ ] Write Usage section with Task pseudocode
   - [ ] Write Arguments table
   - [ ] Write Examples section (4 scenarios)
   - [ ] Write Stage Gates section
   - [ ] Write Error Handling section
   - [ ] Write Related Commands section
   - [ ] Write See Also section
