## 0127. Rename doc-style to wt:topic-draft

### Background

The wt plugin is transitioning to a unified `topic-*` namespace for all workflow commands. The `doc-style` command (Stage 3 of the Technical Content Workflow) needs to be renamed to `wt:topic-draft` for consistency.

The new name `topic-draft` better reflects the command's purpose: generating draft content from outlines or topics. This aligns with the 7-stage workflow naming where Stage 3 is the drafting stage.

This task implements the design from `/Users/robin/projects/cc-agents/docs/plans/2026-01-30-it-writer-agent-redesign.md` which calls for renaming all `doc-*` commands to `topic-*` equivalents.

### Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- Create new command file `/Users/robin/projects/cc-agents/plugins/wt/commands/topic-draft.md`
- Copy content from existing `doc-style.md` with appropriate updates
- Update command name to `topic-draft` throughout
- Remove old `doc-style.md` file

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Maintain backward compatibility (handled in separate task 0131)
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Update internal references to use new command name
- Update examples to reflect new naming

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] New command file exists at `plugins/wt/commands/topic-draft.md`
- [ ] Command frontmatter uses `topic-draft` name
- [ ] Command description updated to reflect new naming and purpose
- [ ] Title/heading updated from "Style Apply" to "Topic Draft"
- [ ] All examples use `/wt:topic-draft` instead of `/wt:doc-style`
- [ ] Stage references updated (e.g., "Stage 3: `/wt:topic-draft`")
- [ ] Related commands section references new names
- [ ] Old `doc-style.md` file removed
- [ ] No broken references to old command name in new file

### Q&A

**Q:** Should I update references in other files?
**A:** No, that's handled by task 0132 (Update documentation/references). This task only creates the new command file and removes the old one.

### Design

**Technology Stack:**
- File copy and rename operation
- Content updates for name consistency

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Read existing `doc-style.md`
2. Create new `topic-draft.md` with updated content
3. Update all command name references
4. Update title/heading from "Style Apply" to "Topic Draft"
5. Update examples to use new name
6. Delete old `doc-style.md`

### Plan

1. **Create New Command File** - Copy and update content
   - [ ] Read `plugins/wt/commands/doc-style.md`
   - [ ] Create `plugins/wt/commands/topic-draft.md`
   - [ ] Update frontmatter: name, description, argument-hint
   - [ ] Update title from "Style Apply" to "Topic Draft"
   - [ ] Update all `/wt:doc-style` references to `/wt:topic-draft`
   - [ ] Update Stage references in Related Commands section
   - [ ] Update Modes table to use new command name
   - [ ] Update See Also section if it references the command name
   - [ ] Verify content is complete and accurate
2. **Remove Old File** - Clean up deprecated command
   - [ ] Delete `plugins/wt/commands/doc-style.md`
