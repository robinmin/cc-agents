## 0115. Fix Missing CLI Command Wrapper

### Background

The SKILL.md documentation shows commands like `wt:image-generate` but no such command wrapper exists in the repo. Users must call the Python script directly with `python plugins/wt/skills/image-generate/scripts/image_generator.py`, which is confusing and doesn't match the documentation.

### Requirements

1. **Create a CLI command wrapper** at `plugins/wt/commands/doc-image.md` (or similar)
2. **Delegate to the Python script** with proper argument passing
3. **Make the command discoverable** via `/wt:doc-image` or similar
4. **Update SKILL.md** if the command path changes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] CLI command wrapper created at `plugins/wt/commands/image-generate.md`
- [x] Command can be invoked via `/wt:image-generate`
- [x] Arguments are properly passed to the Python script
- [x] SKILL.md already documents the correct usage

### Q&A

**Q:** Why create a new command instead of updating `doc-image.md`?
**A:** The existing `doc-image.md` is part of the technical-content-creation workflow and delegates to the `wt:technical-content-creation` skill. The new `image-generate.md` command directly wraps the Python script for standalone use.

### Design

**Solution:**
- Created `image-generate.md` command file at `plugins/wt/commands/image-generate.md`
- Command is discoverable via `/wt:image-generate`
- All arguments are passed directly to the Python script
- Documentation includes:
  - Quick start examples
  - Complete argument reference
  - Style options table
  - Templates reference
  - Environment variables
  - Related commands

**Note:** The existing `doc-image.md` command remains unchanged and continues to serve the technical-content-creation workflow.

**Files Created:**
- `/Users/robin/projects/cc-agents/plugins/wt/commands/image-generate.md`

**Files Unchanged:**
- `/Users/robin/projects/cc-agents/plugins/wt/commands/doc-image.md` (technical-content-creation workflow)
- `/Users/robin/projects/cc-agents/plugins/wt/skills/image-generate/SKILL.md` (already documents `wt:image-generate`)

### Plan

**Phase 1: Implementation**
- [x] Created `image-generate.md` command file
- [x] Added comprehensive documentation
- [x] Included argument reference
- [x] Added style options table
- [x] Added templates reference

**Phase 2: Documentation**
- [x] Command is discoverable via `/wt:image-generate`
- [x] SKILL.md already documents correct usage
- [x] Related commands section added

**Phase 3: Verification**
- [x] Command file exists at correct path
- [x] Command name matches SKILL.md documentation
- [x] Arguments are documented and passed correctly
