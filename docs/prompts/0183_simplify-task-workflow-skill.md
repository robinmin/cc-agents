## 0183. simplify-task-workflow-skill

### Background

The rd2:tasks skill has been massively enhanced (tasks 0182, 0181, 0178) with impl_progress auto-mapping, rich create flags, tiered validation, batch creation, and structured output protocol. Currently, rd2:task-workflow (393 lines) has 7 major redundancies with the enhanced tasks skill: (1) File organization pattern, (2) Frontmatter format, (3) impl_progress tracking mechanics, (4) Status flow & aliases, (5) WBS extraction logic, (6) Validation mechanics, (7) Section update mechanics. The skill mixes workflow orchestration (valuable) with infrastructure mechanics (now redundant). Additionally, the '17-step' workflow structure may be unnecessarily complex - we should evaluate if it can be simplified to 13-15 steps for better clarity and efficiency.

### Requirements

1. Analyze current 17-step workflow and identify opportunities to consolidate/simplify steps. 2. Remove all 7 redundant infrastructure sections from task-workflow. 3. Keep only workflow orchestration logic (decision points, coordination, when to invoke steps). 4. Delegate all task mechanics to rd2:tasks skill via clear references. 5. Optimize workflow to 13-15 steps if possible (not required to maintain 17). 6. Update super-coder.md with minimal changes (add clarification in Philosophy section). 7. Target ~200 lines (down from 393 lines, 49% reduction). 8. Maintain backward compatibility - super-coder workflows must still work. 9. Test with actual super-coder task execution. 10. Document migration notes for deprecated sections.
