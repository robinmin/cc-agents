## 0075. add new Agent Skills coder-agy

### Background

As we already have the following Agents Skills to provide the same interface to execute tasks via different channels:

- plugins/rd2/skills/coder-claude
- plugins/rd2/skills/coder-claude
- plugins/rd2/skills/coder-gemini
- plugins/rd2/skills/coder-opencode

You can refer to `plugins/rd2/skills/coder-opencode` to implement a new Agent Skill in `plugins/rd2/skills/coder-agy` to use Google Antogravity to work with us.

For the details, you can also refer to the following usage:

```bash
agy chat --help
Antigravity 1.104.0

Usage: antigravity chat [options] [prompt]

To read from stdin, append '-' (e.g. 'ps aux | grep code | antigravity chat <prompt> -')

Options
  -m --mode <mode>     The mode to use for the chat session. Available options: 'ask', 'edit', 'agent', or the identifier of a custom mode. Defaults to 'agent'.
  -a --add-file <path> Add files as context to the chat session.
  --maximize           Maximize the chat session view.
  -r --reuse-window    Force to use the last active window for the chat session.
  -n --new-window      Force to open an empty window for the chat session.
```

### Requirements / Objectives

- Refer to `plugins/rd2/skills/coder-opencode` to implement a new Agent Skill in `plugins/rd2/skills/coder-agy` to use Google Antogravity to work with us via `agy chat` command.

- Invoke slash command `/rd2:skill-evaluate plugins/rd2/skills/coder-agy` to evaluate the Agent Skill, and then use `/rd2:skill-refine plugins/rd2/skills/coder-agy` to refine the Agent Skill.
