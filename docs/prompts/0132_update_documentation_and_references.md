## 0132. Update Documentation and References

### Background

The wt plugin has renamed all workflow commands to the `topic-*` namespace. All documentation, cross-references, and related files must be updated to use the new command names for consistency and to avoid user confusion.

This task ensures that:
- Agent documentation references new commands
- Design documents are updated
- Related skills reference new commands
- No stale references remain in the codebase

This task implements the final phase of the design from `/Users/robin/projects/cc-agents/docs/plans/2026-01-30-it-writer-agent-redesign.md`.

### Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- Update `wt:it-writer` agent documentation to reference new command names
- Update related skill documentation
- Update any design documents that reference old command names
- Update README or overview documentation

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Complete coverage: no old command references should remain
- Maintain accuracy in examples
- Preserve all functionality descriptions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `wt:it-writer` agent updated: `/wt:topic-create`, `/wt:topic-outline`, `/wt:topic-draft`, `/wt:topic-adapt`, `/wt:topic-publish`
- [ ] All cross-references in related commands updated
- [ ] Any design documents referencing old commands updated
- [ ] `technical-content-creation` skill documentation updated if it references commands
- [ ] Image-related skills (`image-cover`, `image-illustrator`, `image-generate`) updated if they reference old commands
- [ ] No remaining references to `doc-outline`, `doc-style`, `doc-adapt`, `doc-publish` in documentation (except in alias files)
- [ ] No remaining references to `image-gen`, `image-generate` in documentation (except in alias files)

### Q&A

**Q:** What about code comments or inline documentation?
**A:** Update those as well if they reference command names. The goal is complete consistency.

**Q:** Should I update the design document itself?
**A:** No, the design document is a historical record. It's fine if it describes the plan (past tense) for the rename. Focus on operational documentation.

### Design

**Technology Stack:**
- Grep to find all references to old command names
- Edit tool to update references

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Search for all old command name references
2. Update each reference with new command name
3. Verify no broken references remain
4. Test that command examples still work

**Reference Mapping:**
| Old Command | New Command |
|-------------|-------------|
| `/wt:doc-outline` | `/wt:topic-outline` |
| `/wt:doc-style` | `/wt:topic-draft` |
| `/wt:doc-adapt` | `/wt:topic-adapt` |
| `/wt:doc-publish` | `/wt:topic-publish` |
| `/wt:image-gen` | `/wt:topic-illustrate` |
| `/wt:image-generate` | `/wt:topic-illustrate` |

### Plan

1. **Update Agent Documentation**
   - [ ] Update `plugins/wt/agents/it-writer.md`
   - [ ] Replace all `/wt:doc-*` references with `/wt:topic-*`
   - [ ] Update competency lists
   - [ ] Update examples in description section

2. **Update Related Commands**
   - [ ] Update `plugins/wt/commands/doc-image.md` (if still exists)
   - [ ] Update `plugins/wt/commands/topic-init.md`
   - [ ] Update `plugins/wt/commands/info-seek.md`
   - [ ] Update `plugins/wt/commands/info-research.md`
   - [ ] Replace old command references in Related Commands sections

3. **Update Skill Documentation**
   - [ ] Update `plugins/wt/skills/technical-content-creation/SKILL.md`
   - [ ] Update `plugins/wt/skills/image-cover/SKILL.md`
   - [ ] Update `plugins/wt/skills/image-illustrator/SKILL.md`
   - [ ] Update `plugins/wt/skills/image-generate/SKILL.md`
   - [ ] Replace command references in documentation

4. **Verify All References**
   - [ ] Grep search for remaining `doc-outline` references
   - [ ] Grep search for remaining `doc-style` references
   - [ ] Grep search for remaining `doc-adapt` references
   - [ ] Grep search for remaining `doc-publish` references
   - [ ] Grep search for remaining `image-gen` references
   - [ ] Grep search for remaining `image-generate` references
   - [ ] Confirm only alias files contain old command names
