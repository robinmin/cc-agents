# Lead Research Methodology

This document provides detailed guidance on lead research strategies, data sources, and scoring methodologies.

## Research Strategy Overview

Effective lead research combines multiple data sources and signals to identify companies with both fit and intent. The methodology follows three phases:

1. **Discovery** - Find companies matching basic criteria
2. **Enrichment** - Gather deeper insights and signals
3. **Prioritization** - Score and rank leads for outreach

## Data Sources and Signals

### Primary Signals (Strong Indicators)

| Signal Type | What It Shows | How to Find |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Technology Usage** | Active use of complementary tools | BuiltWith, Wappalyzer, GitHub repos |
| **Job Postings** | Pain points, priorities, growth | LinkedIn Jobs, company careers pages |
| **Recent News** | Timing, initiatives, changes | Google News, press releases, blogs |
| **Funding Events** | Budget availability, growth stage | Crunchbase, PitchBook, TechCrunch |
| **Hiring Velocity** | Growth phase, resource allocation | LinkedIn, company sites, job boards |

### Secondary Signals (Supporting Evidence)

| Signal Type | What It Shows | How to Find |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Social Media Activity** | Company culture, challenges | LinkedIn, Twitter/X |
| **Employee Count Changes** | Growth trajectory | LinkedIn company data |
| **Tech Stack Changes** | New initiatives, migrations | GitHub, public repos |
| **Customer Stories** | Pain points, solutions used | Case studies, testimonials |
| **Competitor Usage** | Market awareness gaps | Competitive analysis |

## Fit Scoring Framework

### Score Components

Calculate fit scores using weighted criteria:

**Basic Fit (40 points)**
- Industry alignment: 15 points
- Company size match: 10 points
- Geographic fit: 10 points
- Technology compatibility: 5 points

**Intent Signals (30 points)**
- Active hiring in relevant roles: 15 points
- Recent funding/growth: 10 points
- Tech stack changes: 5 points

**Urgency Indicators (30 points)**
- Recent relevant job postings: 15 points
- News/pain point signals: 10 points
- Competitive pressures: 5 points

### Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Classification | Outreach Priority |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 80-100 | High Fit + High Intent | Immediate outreach (this week) |
| 60-79 | Good Fit + Some Intent | Priority outreach (this month) |
| 40-59 | Basic Fit + Low Intent | Standard nurture sequence |
| 20-39 | Limited Fit | Monitor for signals |
| 0-19 | Poor Fit | Exclude from outreach |

## Outreach Personalization Framework

### Personalization Matrix

| Data Point | Personalization Angle | Example |
|------------|----------------------|---------|
| Recent News | Tie to current initiative | "Saw your Series B announcement" |
| Job Posting | Address specific pain point | "Noticed you're hiring DevOps engineers" |
| Tech Stack | Complement current setup | "Since you're using Kubernetes..." |
| Company Event | Acknowledge milestone | "Congrats on the product launch" |
| Employee Post | Reference thought leadership | "Loved your post about remote work" |

### Value Proposition Mapping

Match value prop to lead type:

**Technical Buyers** (CTO, VP Engineering):
- Focus on: Performance, reliability, integration
- Avoid: Marketing fluff
- Proof: Technical specs, benchmarks, case studies

**Business Buyers** (CEO, VP Sales):
- Focus on: ROI, time-to-value, competitive advantage
- Avoid: Technical jargon
- Proof: Metrics, testimonials, business outcomes

**Operations Buyers** (Head of Ops):
- Focus on: Efficiency, process improvement, ease of adoption
- Avoid: Disruption, complexity
- Proof: Implementation timeline, onboarding support

## Common Research Patterns

### Pattern 1: "Technology First" Research

1. Start with technology keywords (e.g., "uses Cursor", "Kubernetes")
2. Find companies using that technology
3. Filter by industry/size
4. Enrich with company context
5. Score based on fit and timing

**Best for**: Developer tools, infrastructure, technical products

### Pattern 2: "Growth Stage" Research

1. Identify funding stage (Seed, Series A, B, C)
2. Find companies at that stage
3. Analyze hiring patterns for pain points
4. Map product to growth challenges
5. Prioritize by recency of funding

**Best for**: HR tools, finance, operations, scaling tools

### Pattern 3: "Industry Event" Research

1. Monitor industry news/events (regulations, trends)
2. Identify affected companies
3. Assess impact severity
4. Position product as solution
5. Time outreach to event

**Best for**: Compliance, security, risk management tools

## Quality Validation Checklist

Before presenting leads to users, verify:

- [ ] Company exists and is active (website loads, recent activity)
- [ ] Basic criteria match (industry, size, location)
- [ ] At least 2 supporting signals identified
- [ ] Fit score calculated consistently
- [ ] Decision maker role is appropriate
- [ ] Value proposition is specific to the company
- [ ] Outreach strategy references real data points
- [ ] No obvious red flags (company in crisis, recent layoffs)

## Iterative Improvement

Track which leads convert to refine the model:

1. **Log accepted leads** - Which companies users choose to outreach
2. **Track response rates** - Which lead sources respond best
3. **Note winning patterns** - Common characteristics of good leads
4. **Adjust scoring** - Weight signals based on actual outcomes
5. **Update methodology** - Incorporate learnings into future research
