# AI Coding Best Practices - Source Material

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of best practices for using AI coding assistants in software development.

## Key Principles

1. **Understand Before Accepting** - Always review AI-generated code before implementation
2. **Maintain Code Ownership** - You are responsible for all code in your codebase
3. **Verify Functionality** - Test AI suggestions thoroughly
4. **Security First** - Never blindly accept code that could introduce vulnerabilities
5. **Document Decisions** - Keep track of why certain AI suggestions were accepted

## Best Practices

### Code Review

- Review AI-generated code with the same rigor as human code
- Check for edge cases and error handling
- Ensure code follows project style guidelines
- Validate algorithmic correctness

### Security Considerations

- Never share sensitive information with AI systems
- Be aware of data privacy implications
- Check for hardcoded secrets in AI suggestions
- Validate inputs even when AI provides validation code

### Learning and Improvement

- Use AI as a learning tool, not a replacement for understanding
- Ask AI to explain its suggestions
- Compare AI output with documentation
- Build mental models of how things work

## Conclusion

AI coding assistants are powerful tools when used responsibly. Following these best practices ensures you get the benefits while maintaining code quality and security.
