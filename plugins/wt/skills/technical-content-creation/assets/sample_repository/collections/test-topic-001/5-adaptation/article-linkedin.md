# AI Coding Best Practices: A Guide for Developers

AI coding assistants have transformed our development workflow, but using them effectively requires discipline and best practices.

## Key Principles

### 1. Understand Before Accepting

AI-generated code should never be accepted without understanding. Take time to review implementations and verify they meet your requirements.

### 2. Apply Rigorous Review Standards

The same standards applied to human-written code should apply to AI-generated code. Check for:
- Edge cases and error handling
- Performance implications
- Security vulnerabilities

### 3. Security Considerations

Never share sensitive information with AI systems. Be aware of data privacy implications and always scan for hardcoded secrets.

### 4. Learning and Growth

Use AI as a learning tool, not a replacement for understanding. Ask for explanations and build your technical knowledge.

## The Bottom Line

AI coding assistants enhance our capabilities when used responsibly. Following these best practices ensures quality, security, and continuous improvement.
