# AI Coding Best Practices: A Developer's Guide

AI coding assistants have become indispensable tools for modern developers. But with great power comes great responsibility. Here is how to use them effectively.

## Why Best Practices Matter

- Check edge cases and error handling
- Maintain style consistency

### Security

- Never share sensitive information
- Be aware of data privacy
- Detect hardcoded secrets

### Learning

- Use AI as a learning tool
- Ask for explanations
- Build technical understanding

## Conclusion

AI coding assistants are powerful tools that can significantly improve developer productivity when used responsibly.
