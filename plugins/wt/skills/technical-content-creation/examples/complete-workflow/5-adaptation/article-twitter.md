# Effective Code Documentation Thread

1/5 The documentation crisis is real.

Developers spend up to 30% of their time understanding existing code instead of building features.

Poor documentation costs teams time, money, and sanity.

Let's fix this. #Documentation #DevTools

2/5 Good documentation = empathy.

Write for your future self (6 months from now, you'll forget why you wrote that code).

Write for the new team member who started today.

Explain *why*, not just *what*. The code already tells you what it does. #SoftwareEngineering

3/5 The documentation spectrum:

• Comments: Non-obvious implementation details
• API docs: Usage examples, parameters, return types
• Architecture: System design and component relationships
• README: Project overview, setup, contribution guide

Use each where it fits.

4/5 Quick wins to start today:

1. Document the most confusing function in your codebase
2. Add a README to one undocumented project
3. Write examples for your most-used API
4. Make docs part of code review

Small steps add up.

5/5 Every line of code tells a story.

Documentation captures that story for the next person.

Write documentation as a gift to your future self. You'll thank yourself later.

Better docs = better software. It's that simple.
