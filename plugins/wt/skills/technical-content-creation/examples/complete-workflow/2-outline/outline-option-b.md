# Outline Option B: Narrative/Story-driven Approach

**Style**: Engaging flow with real-world examples and storytelling
**Best for**: Blog posts, educational content, developer onboarding

## 1. The Documentation Crisis
   - A relatable tale of undocumented code
   - The frustration of cryptic functions
   - The cost of poor documentation
   - Why we're here: A call to action

## 2. A New Mindset: Documentation as Empathy
   - Writing for your future self
   - The reader's journey
   - Documentation as a conversation

## 3. The Documentation Spectrum
   - Comments vs. docs: Finding the balance
   - When to document what
   - The danger of over-documenting
   - Self-documenting code: Myth or reality?

## 4. Real-World Examples: Good vs. Bad
   - Case study 1: The cryptic function

## 8. The Human Side of Documentation
   - Documentation as teamwork
   - Collaborative writing
   - Giving and receiving feedback
   - Documentation in distributed teams
   - The emotional aspect of sharing knowledge

## 9. The Future of Documentation
   - AI-assisted documentation: Promise and peril
   - Interactive and executable documentation
   - Documentation as user experience
   - Real-time synchronization
   - The evolving role of technical writers

## 10. Your Documentation Journey
   - Starting where you are
   - Quick wins for immediate impact
   - Building sustainable habits
   - Scaling to teams and projects
   - Resources for continued growth

## 11. Conclusion: Every Line Tells a Story
