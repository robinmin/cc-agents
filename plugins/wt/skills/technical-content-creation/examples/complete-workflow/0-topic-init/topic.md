## Additional Notes

This example demonstrates the complete 7-stage workflow for technical content creation. The topic progresses through all stages from materials extraction to multi-platform publishing.

## Stage Progression

- Stage 0: Materials - Extracted documentation best practices from multiple sources
- Stage 1: Research - Conducted systematic research on documentation methodologies
- Stage 2: Outline - Generated 3 outline options, selected narrative approach (Option B)
- Stage 3: Draft - Wrote full article using technical-writer style profile
- Stage 4: Illustration - Generated cover image and 3 inline illustrations
- Stage 5: Adaptation - Adapted for Twitter, LinkedIn, and Dev.to
- Stage 6: Publish - Published to blog with comprehensive logging

## Key Demonstrations

1. Multi-option outline generation and selection
2. Image-aware workflow with wt:image-cover and wt:image-illustrator
3. Cross-platform content adaptation
4. Comprehensive publish logging
