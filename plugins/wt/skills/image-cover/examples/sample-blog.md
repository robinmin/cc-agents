# Finding Joy in Small Moments: A Year of Mindfulness

Last January, I made a simple resolution: find one moment of joy every day. What started as a challenge became a transformative practice that changed how I experience daily life.

## The Beginning

The first week was surprisingly difficult. I found myself hunting for "worthy" moments—big accomplishments, exciting events, Instagram-worthy experiences. But true joy, I discovered, lives in the smallest places.

## What I Learned

**Morning coffee** became a ritual of warmth and possibility. The steam rising, the aroma, those first quiet moments before the world wakes up.

**Walks outside** revealed beauty I'd never noticed—the iridescent sheen on a crow's feather, the way sunlight filters through different trees, the sound of rain on pavement.

**Evening pauses** between work and rest became sacred. Five minutes to just breathe, acknowledge the day, and transition intentionally.

## The Practice

Find what works for you. Maybe it's:
- Noticing three things you're grateful for
- Taking three conscious breaths
- Pausing to really see your surroundings

The key isn't perfection. It's presence.

## One Year Later

I still miss days. I still have weeks where life feels like a blur. But now I have an anchor—a simple practice that brings me back to what matters: connection, awareness, and the quiet joy of being alive.

*What small moment brings you joy? I'd love to hear about it.*
