# Evaluate Skill Quality

Comprehensive read-only evaluation of a Claude Code Agent Skill against best practices, quality standards, and security requirements.

## Purpose

Analyze an existing skill and generate a detailed quality report without making any changes. Provides objective assessment with specific recommendations for improvement.

## Usage

```bash
/rd:skill-evaluate <skill-folder>
```

### Arguments

- `skill-folder` (required): Path to skill directory to evaluate
  - Can be relative: `skills/my-skill`
  - Can be absolute: `/Users/robin/projects/cc-agents/plugins/rd/skills/my-skill`
  - Can be skill name only: `my-skill` (searches in current plugin)

## Examples

**Evaluate skill in current plugin:**
```bash
/rd:skill-evaluate 10-stages-developing
```

**Evaluate skill with full path:**
```bash
/rd:skill-evaluate plugins/rd/skills/code-review
```

**Evaluate skill in another plugin:**
```bash
/rd:skill-evaluate plugins/hello/skills/greeting-messages
```

### Security Assessment (20%)

**CRITICAL: This section is mandatory for skills containing scripts, shell commands, or file operations.**

**Evaluation Factors:**

| Category | What to Check |
|----------|---------------|
| **Command Injection** | User input used in shell commands without sanitization |
| **Path Traversal** | Unchecked file paths allowing `../` escape |
| **Secrets Exposure** | Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens |
| **Input Validation** | Missing type/boundary/format checks |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Unnecessary sudo, root, or admin operations |
| **Network Access** | Uncontrolled external connections |
| **Data Exfiltration** | Potential for sending data to external services |

**Critical Security Anti-Patterns:**

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Risk |
|--------------|---------|------|
| **Shell injection** | `os.system(f"rm {user_input}")` | Arbitrary command execution |
| **Unsanitized paths** | `open(user_path)` without validation | Read/write arbitrary files |
| **Hardcoded secrets** | `API_KEY = "sk-..."` | Credential theft |
| **Eval on user input** | `eval(user_code)` | Code execution |
| **Unrestricted network** | `requests.get(user_url)` | SSRF, data leak |
| **Excessive permissions** | `chmod 777`, `sudo` without justification | Privilege escalation |
| **Unsafe deserialization** | `pickle.load(user_data)` | Code execution |

**Secure Patterns to Verify:**

| Pattern | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Input sanitization** | Allowlist validation, regex patterns, type checking |
| **Path restriction** | `os.path.realpath()` + prefix check, chroot |
| **Secret management** | Environment variables, secret managers, no hardcoding |
| **Subprocess safety** | `subprocess.run([...], shell=False)`, shlex.quote() |
| **Least privilege** | Minimal permissions, no sudo unless documented |
| **Network allowlist** | Explicit allowed domains, no user-controlled URLs |

**Security Severity Levels:**

| Level | Criteria | Action Required |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Immediate exploitation possible, data loss/theft risk | Block deployment, fix immediately |
| 🟠 **High** | Exploitation with some effort, significant impact | Fix before production |
| 🟡 **Medium** | Limited exploitation, moderate impact | Fix in next iteration |
| 🟢 **Low** | Theoretical risk, minimal impact | Document and monitor |

**N/A Conditions:**
- Skill contains no scripts, commands, or file operations

❌ **Does not alter structure**

To apply improvements, use `/rd:skill-refine` after reviewing the evaluation report.

## When to Use

**Use evaluate-skill when:**

- Preparing skill for release/sharing
- Learning best practices through analysis
- Comparing different skill approaches
- Need detailed improvement roadmap

**Use skill-refine when:**
- Ready to make actual improvements
- Want guided interactive refinement
- Prefer automated fixes where possible

**Use both in sequence:**
```bash
# 1. Get assessment
/rd:skill-evaluate my-skill

# 2. Review report and decide on fixes

# 3. Apply improvements
/rd:skill-refine my-skill

# 4. Verify improvements
/rd:skill-evaluate my-skill
```

## Troubleshooting

**Skill not found:**
- Verify path is correct
- Check skill exists in specified location
- Try full absolute path

**Report too long:**
- Focus on highest priority sections
- Ask for summary of specific categories
- Request condensed version

**Disagree with assessment:**
- Review evaluation criteria reference
- Check against official best practices
- Consider if Claude's knowledge changed
- Provide feedback on specific points

**Want specific category details:**
- Ask Claude to expand specific section
- Request examples of issues found
- Ask for comparison with best practices
