## User Experience Impact

### Before (Typical User Journey)
1. User: "How do I use /rd:10-dev-apply?"
2. Opens apply-10-dev.md
3. Reads 465 lines trying to find usage syntax
4. Gets lost in detailed explanations
5. Confused about difference vs documentation
6. Eventually finds usage examples on line 400
7. **Friction**: "Just tell me HOW to use it!"

### After (Improved Journey)
1. User: "How do I use /rd:10-dev-apply?"
2. Opens apply-10-dev.md
3. Sees clear sections: Purpose → Usage → Examples
4. Finds exactly what they need in first 50 lines
5. "See Also" links to deep dives if needed
6. **Delight**: "Perfect! Quick reference with depth available"
