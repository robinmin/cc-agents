# Command Evaluation Framework

10-dimension quality evaluation for slash commands with configurable weight profiles, organized into 5 MECE categories.

## Dimensions Overview

Organized into 5 MECE categories (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive):

| # | Category | Dimension | With Pseudocode | Without Pseudocode | What It Checks |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|----|
| 1 | Metadata | Frontmatter Quality | 15 | 18 | Valid YAML, only allowed fields, no invalid fields |
| 2 | Metadata | Description Effectiveness | 15 | 18 | Under 60 chars, starts with verb, specific |
| 3 | Metadata | Naming Convention | 5 | 7 | noun-verb for grouped, verb-noun for simple |
| 4 | Content | Content Quality | 12 | 15 | Imperative form, no second-person, writes FOR Claude |
| 5 | Content | Structure & Brevity | 10 | 12 | Under 150 lines, progressive disclosure |
| 6 | Architecture | Delegation Architecture | 12 | 5 | Uses Skill()/Task() properly, fat skills thin wrappers |
| 7 | Architecture | Argument Design | 8 | 10 | argument-hint present when $N used, descriptive |
| 8 | Security | Security | 10 | 8 | allowed-tools restrictive, no dangerous patterns |
| 9 | Security | Circular Reference Prevention | 5 | 5 | No /rd3:command-* refs or Commands Reference sections |
| 10 | Platform | Cross-Platform Portability | 8 | 2 | Claude-specific features documented |
| | | **Total** | **100** | **100** | |

## Weight Profiles

### With Pseudocode (workflow commands)

Commands using Task(), Skill(), SlashCommand(), or AskUserQuestion() are weighted toward delegation quality and platform compatibility. Content quality and structure brevity also receive higher weights.

### Without Pseudocode (simple commands)

Commands with direct instructions are weighted toward frontmatter quality, description clarity, and content quality. Delegation architecture receives lower weight since there are no pseudocode constructs.

## Dimension Details

### Metadata Category

#### 1. Frontmatter Quality (15/18)

- YAML parses without errors
- Only valid fields present (description, allowed-tools, model, argument-hint, disable-model-invocation)
- No invalid fields (name, skills, subagents, version, etc.)
- Field values have correct types (model is string enum, allowed-tools is string/array, etc.)

#### 2. Description Effectiveness (15/18)

- Under 60 characters
- Starts with a verb (Review, Deploy, Generate)
- Does not start with "This command"
- Specific enough to differentiate from other commands
- No redundant words ("command", "slash command")

#### 3. Naming Convention (5/7)

- Grouped commands use noun-verb pattern (e.g., task-create, skill-evaluate)
- Simple commands use verb-noun pattern (e.g., review-code)
- Full namespace used (plugin-name:command-name)
- Hyphen-case, lowercase

### Content Category

#### 4. Content Quality (12/15)

- Uses imperative form (not second-person "you should")
- Writes instructions FOR Claude (not messages TO user)
- Clear, actionable instructions
- No hallucinated tool names or non-existent APIs
- Proper markdown formatting

#### 5. Structure & Brevity (10/12)

- Total lines under ~150 (thin wrapper principle)
- Progressive disclosure with sections
- Well-organized with clear headers
- No excessive boilerplate or redundant content

### Architecture Category

#### 6. Delegation Architecture (12/5)

- Uses Skill(), Task(), SlashCommand() properly
- Follows fat skills, thin wrappers principle
- Delegates to skills (not agents) from commands
- Pseudocode is clear and structured

#### 7. Argument Design (8/10)

- argument-hint present when body uses $1, $2, $ARGUMENTS
- Descriptive argument names (not arg1, arg2)
- Consistent with body usage
- Square or angle brackets for each argument

### Security Category

#### 8. Security (10/8)

- allowed-tools is as restrictive as possible
- Bash uses command filters (Bash(git:*) not Bash)
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- No dangerous shell patterns (rm -rf, sudo, etc.)
- Security blacklist/greylist scanning

#### 9. Circular Reference Prevention (5/5)

- No "Commands Reference" sections
- No explicit skill references by name (e.g., "rd3:some-skill")
- No "See also" with specific skill references
- Uses generic delegation patterns instead

### Platform Category

#### 10. Cross-Platform Portability (8/2)

- Claude-specific features documented (Task, Skill, $ARGUMENTS, !`cmd`, etc.)
- Platform Notes section present if using non-portable features
- Portable alternatives suggested where possible
- Cross-platform adaptation feasibility assessed

## Grading Scale

| Grade | Score Range | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| A | 90-100 | Excellent: production-ready |
| B | 80-89 | Good: minor improvements needed |
| C | 70-79 | Acceptable: some issues to address |
| D | 60-69 | Below standard: significant issues |
| F | < 60 | Failing: major rework needed |

## Security Gatekeeper

See [red-flags.md](red-flags.md) for the complete 10-category red flags checklist.

Commands are automatically rejected (grade F, failed) if they contain:

**Blacklist (immediate rejection):**
- Hardcoded API keys, tokens, passwords
- Base64-encoded suspicious strings
- Known malicious patterns (exec, eval, shell injection)

**Greylist (score penalty):**
- Unrestricted Bash access
- Missing allowed-tools
- Overly broad tool permissions
- Shell injection patterns

## Passing Threshold

Default passing threshold: **80/100** (Grade B or above).

Configurable via `evaluation.config.ts`.
