## Skill Structure Patterns

### Minimal Skill

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md
```

**When to use:** Simple knowledge, no complex resources needed

### Standard Skill (Recommended)

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   └── detailed-guide.md
└── scripts/
    └── utility.ts
```

**When to use:** Most skills with detailed documentation

### Complete Skill

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   ├── patterns.md
│   ├── best-practices.md
│   └── troubleshooting.md
├── scripts/
│   ├── scaffold.ts
│   └── validate.ts
└── agents/
    └── openai.yaml
```

**When to use:** Complex domains with platform adapters

---

## Frontmatter Templates

### Basic Template

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "specific phrase 1", "specific phrase 2", or mentions domain-specific terms.
---
```

### With Metadata

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "specific phrase 1", "specific phrase 2", or mentions domain-specific terms.
metadata:
  platforms: claude-code,codex,openclaw,opencode,antigravity
  version: 1.0.0
---
```

### Comprehensive Example

```yaml
---
name: oauth-integration
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "implement OAuth2", "add Google authentication", "configure OAuth providers", "set up SSO", or mentions OAuth flows, authorization codes, or token management.
metadata:
  platforms: claude-code,codex,openclaw,opencode
  version: 2.1.0
---
```

## Quality Dimensions

| Dimension | What It Checks |
|-----------|---------------|
| Frontmatter | Valid YAML, name, description quality |
| Content | Length, sections, examples |
| Structure | Progressive disclosure, organization |
| Security | No dangerous patterns |
| Best Practices | Naming, conventions |

## CLI Commands

### Scaffold (Create New Skill)

```bash
bun scripts/scaffold.ts my-skill --path ./skills
```

### Evaluate (Validate)

```bash
# Basic validation
bun scripts/evaluate.ts ./skills/my-skill --scope basic

# Full evaluation with scoring
bun scripts/evaluate.ts ./skills/my-skill --scope full

# JSON output
bun scripts/evaluate.ts ./skills/my-skill --json
```

### Refine (Improve)

```bash
# Migrate from rd2
bun scripts/refine.ts ./skills/my-skill --migrate

# Apply best practices fixes
bun scripts/refine.ts ./skills/my-skill --best-practices

# Generate platform companions
bun scripts/refine.ts ./skills/my-skill --platform all

# Dry run
bun scripts/refine.ts ./skills/my-skill --dry-run
```

### Package (Distribute)

```bash
# Package skill
bun scripts/package.ts ./skills/my-skill

# Custom output
bun scripts/package.ts ./skills/my-skill --output ./dist
```
