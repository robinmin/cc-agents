# rd3:brainstorm — Structured Ideation Workflow

Generate solution options with trade-offs, recommendations, and confidence scoring. Delegates research to specialized skills.

**Key distinction:**
- **`rd3:brainstorm`** = Ideation: generate approaches with trade-offs
- **`rd3:knowledge-extraction`** = Research: verify and synthesize information
- **`rd3:task-decomposition`** = Task creation: structured task breakdown
- **`rd3:anti-hallucination`** = Verification: source-first claim validation

## Overview

The `rd3:brainstorm` skill generates multiple solution approaches with explicit trade-offs, confidence scoring, and source citations. It follows a structured 3-phase workflow: Input parsing, Ideation with research delegation, and structured Output. Unlike pure research (knowledge-extraction) or task creation (task-decomposition), brainstorm focuses on ideation—generating and comparing options before committing to a solution path.

## Quick Start

```typescript
// Trigger: "I need to add real-time collaboration. What are my options?"
// Brainstorm generates 2-3 approaches with trade-offs, delegates research and task creation
```

**3-Phase Workflow:**

```
1. INPUT    → Parse (file path or issue description), extract context
2. IDEATE   → Generate approaches with trade-offs (delegate research to knowledge-extraction)
3. OUTPUT   → Structured markdown, optional task delegation
```

## When to Use

Activate rd3:brainstorm when:

| Trigger Phrase | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| "brainstorm ideas" | User wants multiple solution options |
| "explore solutions" | User wants to evaluate alternatives |
| "consider options" | User wants trade-off analysis |
| "research approaches" | User wants evidence-backed options |
| "what are my options?" | User wants multiple solutions |
| "how should I approach X?" | User wants recommendation with reasoning |

**NOT for:**
- Pure research (use `rd3:knowledge-extraction` instead)
- Task creation without ideation (use `rd3:task-decomposition` instead)
- Fact-checking or verification only (use `rd3:anti-hallucination` instead)
- Task file operations (use `rd3:tasks` instead)

## Core Principles

### 1. Two Input Modes

```
IF input contains "/" or "\" AND ends with ".md":
    → Treat as file path → read and extract context
ELSE:
    → Treat as issue description → use directly
```

### 2. Clarify Before Ideating

Use `AskUserQuestion` for ambiguous or insufficient input:

**Clarification triggers:**
- Input < 20 characters
- Missing Background or Requirements (if from task file)
- Undefined technical terms
- Multiple valid interpretations

**Format:** One question at a time, prefer multiple choice options.

### 3. Delegate Research

Don't implement research directly. Delegate to specialized skills:

```
For verification → rd3:anti-hallucination
For synthesis → rd3:knowledge-extraction
```

### 4. Generate 2-3 Approaches

Always generate multiple options:

```
Approach 1: [Name] ⭐ Recommended
  - Description: 2-3 sentences
  - Trade-offs: Pros / Cons
  - Confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
  - Sources: [Citations]

Approach 2: [Name]
  [... same structure ...]

Approach 3: [Name]
  [... same structure ...]
```

### 5. Confidence Scoring

| Level | Score | Criteria |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **HIGH** | >90% | Direct quote from official docs (2025+), verified today |
| **MEDIUM** | 70-90% | Synthesized from multiple sources |
| **LOW** | <70% | Uncertain, needs verification, flag for review |

**Always cite sources with dates:**
```markdown
**Source**: [URL]
**Verified**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Confidence**: HIGH
```

### 6. Task Delegation

When user confirms approach, delegate task creation:

```
// Pseudocode: Delegate to rd3:task-decomposition for structured task breakdown
Skill("rd3:task-decomposition", args: "convert <approach> to tasks")

// Then use rd3:tasks for file creation
Bash: tasks batch-create --from-json decomposition.json
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Input Processing

**Goal:** Parse and validate input, extract context

**Input detection:**
1. Check if path → read file, parse YAML frontmatter
2. Extract Background, Requirements sections
3. Validate non-empty content

**Clarification:**
- Use `AskUserQuestion` for ambiguous input
- One question at a time
- Prefer multiple choice

### Phase 2: Ideation (Research + Generation)

**Goal:** Generate 2-3 solution approaches with trade-offs

**Research delegation:**
```
1. Invoke rd3:anti-hallucination for verification protocol
2. Invoke rd3:knowledge-extraction for synthesis
3. Generate approaches based on verified information
```

**Approach structure:**
```markdown
### Approach N: [Descriptive Name] ⭐ (if recommended)

**Description:** 2-3 sentences explaining the approach

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pros:**
  - Advantage 1
  - Advantage 2
- **Cons:**
  - Disadvantage 1
  - Disadvantage 2

**Implementation Notes:**
- Key technical considerations
- Dependencies or prerequisites

**Confidence:** HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
**Sources:** [Citations with dates]
```

### Phase 3: Output

**Goal:** Format and deliver structured results

**Output sections:**
1. **Overview** — Context and problem summary (100-150 words)
2. **Approaches** — 2-3 options with trade-offs (200-300 words each)
3. **Recommendations** — Recommended approach with reasoning
4. **Next Steps** — Potential task items

**Interactive delivery:**
```
1. Show Overview → "Does this capture the problem?"
2. Show Approaches → "Any clarifications on these options?"
3. Show Recommendations → "Ready for task creation?"
```

**File saving:**
```
docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-brainstorm.md
```

## Tool Selection

| Research Need | Delegate To | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Verification protocol | `rd3:anti-hallucination` | Source-first validation |
| Information synthesis | `rd3:knowledge-extraction` | Multi-source consolidation |
| Task breakdown | `rd3:task-decomposition` | Structured tasks |
| Task file creation | `rd3:tasks` | WBS assignment, kanban |

## Error Handling

| Phase | Error | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Input | File not found | Clear error, suggest checking path |
| Input | Empty content | Ask for clarification |
| Ideation | Tool unavailable | Continue with available, note reduced confidence |
| Output | Save fails | Display output, suggest manual save |
| Tasks | CLI fails | Report error, suggest manual creation |

## Anti-Hallucination Integration

rd3:brainstorm delegates verification to rd3:anti-hallucination:

**Protocol:**
1. **CHECK** — Does this claim need verification?
2. **SELECT** — Best tool for information type
3. **SEARCH** — Execute verification
4. **CITE** — Include source with date
5. **SCORE** — Assign confidence level

**Confidence levels:**
- **HIGH**: Direct quote from official docs (2025+)
- **MEDIUM**: Synthesized from multiple sources
- **LOW**: Uncertain, flag for review

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| Skipping clarification | Always validate input clarity before ideation |
| Single approach only | Always generate 2-3 options with trade-offs |
| Missing confidence scoring | Cite sources and assign confidence to each approach |
| Over-ideating | Limit to 3 approaches; delegate deeper research |
| Skipping task delegation | Offer task creation after user confirms approach |
| Ignoring graceful degradation | Continue with available tools if research tools fail |

## Best Practices

- **Input first** — Clarify before generating to avoid rework
- **Delegate research** — Use specialized skills, don't reimplement
- **Evidence-based** — Always cite sources with dates
- **Trade-off clarity** — Make pros/cons explicit for each approach
- **Interactive delivery** — Show sections incrementally, confirm understanding
- **Concrete next steps** — Convert recommendations to actionable tasks

## Platform Notes

### Claude Code

- Use `AskUserQuestion` for clarification prompts
- Use `Skill` to delegate to research skills
- Use `Bash` with `tasks` CLI for task creation

### Other Platforms

- Delegate research via `rd3:knowledge-extraction`
- Delegate tasks via `rd3:task-decomposition`
- Output format is platform-agnostic markdown

**Remember:** Ideation ≠ Research. Generate approaches with trade-offs. Delegate verification to anti-hallucination. Delegate synthesis to knowledge-extraction. Delegate task creation to task-decomposition.
