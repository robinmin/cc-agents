# Platform Compatibility

The platform matrix is sourced from `docs/main_agents.md` and encoded in
`scripts/capabilities.ts`.

Support levels are capability-based:

- High confidence: official documentation verified on 2026-04-30.
- Medium confidence: official or semi-official docs exist but are fragmented.
- Low confidence: community-only or no stable official documentation found.

Adapters must emit loss reports when source behavior cannot be represented
natively by the target platform.
